The standard FLN spectra were used to prove that a major depurination adduct from the binding of BP to DNA in rat liver nuclei is 7-(benzo[a]pyren-6-yl)guanine (N7Gua). The structural characterization was performed with only 20 pg of the adduct. Metabolic activation of BP by one-electron oxidation in the horseradish peroxidase catalyzed reaction of BP with DNA (in vitro) was also investigated.

The transcription factor Bach2 regulates both acquired and innate immunity at multiple steps, including antibody class switching and regulatory T cell development in activated B and T cells, respectively. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of Bach2 regulation in response to signaling of cytokines and antigen. We show here that 	mammalian target of rapamycin	 (mTOR) controls Bach2 along B cell differentiation with two distinct mechanisms in pre-B cells. First, mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) inhibited accumulation of Bach2 protein in nuclei and reduced its stability. Second, mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) inhibited FoxO1 to reduce Bach2 mRNA expression. Using expression profiling and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, the Ccnd3 gene, encoding cyclin D3, was identified as a new direct target of Bach2. A proper cell cycle was lost at pre-B and mature B cell stages in Bach2-deficient mice. Furthermore, AZD8055, an mTOR inhibitor, increased class switch recombination in wild-type mature B cells but not in Bach2-deficient cells. These

NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity increased with increasing tumor grade and the binding complex mainly consisted of NF-kappaB/p65-p50 heterodimers. Immunohistochemical analysis showed enhanced nuclear staining for NF-kappaB/p65 in both high-grade (P <.0001) and low-grade (P <.003) cancer specimens, compared to benign tissue. The nuclear levels of NF-kappaB/p65 correlated with concurrent increase in cytosolic levels of IkappaBalpha along with NF-kappaB-dependent expression of Bcl2, cyclin D1, MMP-9, and VEGF.

Western blot analysis showed that insulin induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and insulin receptor substrate-1 in hCMEC/D3 cells. Short-term insulin stimulation increased cell proliferation via the canonical phosphoinositide-3 kinase/protein kinase B and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways, suggesting that insulin signaling is involved in the regulation of biologic responses in the human BBB. We also found that insulin rapidly increased tight-junction integrity of hCMEC/D3 cells via the phosphoinositide-3 kinase/protein kinase B/glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta signaling pathway. Inhibition of insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor kinase by AG1024 blocked the increase of tight-junction integrity. In addition, high-insulin/high-	glucose	 treatment (as a model of hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia) synergistically reduced the tight-junction integrity in hCMEC/D3 cells, although either condition alone had little or no effect. Our findings suggest that, in addition to the established role of interactions of astrocytes and pericytes with brain capillary endothelial cells, insulin signaling from the blood side of the BBB contributes to maintenance of homeostasis by regulating cell proliferation and tight-junction integrity.

In multivariable logistic regression, only adrenaline (21 %) was independently associated with increased 90-day mortality (OR 5.2, 95 % CI 1.88, 14.7, p = 0.002). The result was independent of prior cardiac arrest (39 % of patients treated with adrenaline), and the association remained in propensity-score-adjusted analysis among vasopressor-treated patients (OR 3.0, 95 % CI 1.3, 7.2, p = 0.013); this was further confirmed by propensity-score-matched analysis. 	Adrenaline	 was also associated, independent of prior cardiac arrest, with marked worsening of cardiac and renal biomarkers during the first days. Dobutamine and levosimendan were the most commonly used inotropes (49 % and 24 %). There were no differences in mortality, whether noradrenaline was combined with dobutamine or levosimendan. CONCLUSION: Among vasopressors and inotropes, adrenaline was independently associated with 90-day mortality in CS. Moreover, adrenaline use was associated with marked worsening in cardiac and renal biomarkers. The combined use of noradrenaline with either dobutamine or levosimendan appeared prognostically similar. DOCEND

This RPE-specific protein was found to be nonglycosylated. It was most effectively solubilized in the presence of detergent suggesting that it is associated with the RPE cell membranes. Its partitioning in the detergent phase of Triton X-114 and its solubilization in 0.75 M and 1.0 M KCl suggest that it interacts with 	the membrane	 either through a polypeptide anchor or charged amino acids. Cell fractionation by differential solubilization and differential centrifugation demonstrated that the protein was preferentially associated with the microsomal membrane fraction, where it is the major protein. Developmental expression of this 65 kD protein was examined in neonatal rats. Morphologically well-differentiated RPE cells did not express the 65 kD protein at birth. However, expression was detectable at postnatal day 4, that is, one to two days before the photoreceptors develop their outer segments, suggesting that the expression of the 65 kD protein may be coordinated with other developmental events in the intact

In mouse models of SCC (orthotopic UV-induced lesions, and subcutaneous A431 and 4T1 tumors), pretreatment with 5-FU for 3 days followed by ALA for 4 hours led to large, tumor-selective increases in PpIX levels, and enhanced cell death upon illumination. Several mechanisms were identified that might explain the relatively improved therapeutic response. First, the expression of key enzymes in the heme synthesis pathway was altered, including upregulated coproporphyrinogen oxidase and downregulated ferrochelatase. Second, a 3- to 6-fold induction of p53 in 5-FU-pretreated tumors was noted. The fact that A431 contains a mutant form 	p53	 did not prevent the development of a neoadjuvantal 5-FU effect. Furthermore, 5-FU pretreatment of 4T1 tumors (cells that completely lack p53), still led to significant beneficial inductions, that is, 2.5-fold for both PpIX and PDT-induced cell death.

10906134	T51	out	DOCSTART Regulation of DNA-dependent protein kinase activity by ionizing radiation-activated abl kinase is an ATM-dependent process. Ionizing radiation (IR) treatment results in activation of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase c-Abl because of phosphorylation by ATM. In vitro evidence indicates that DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) can also phosphorylate and thus potentially activate Abl kinase activity in response to IR exposure. To unravel the role of ATM and DNA-PK in the activation of Abl, we assayed Abl, ATM, and DNA-PK activity in ATM- and DNA-PKcs-deficient cells after irradiation. 	Our results	 show that despite the presence of higher than normal levels of DNA-PK kinase activity, c-Abl fails to become activated after IR exposure in ATM-deficient cells. Conversely, normal activation of both ATM and c-Abl occurs in DNA-PKcs-deficient cells, indicating that ATM but not DNA-PK is required for activation of Abl in response to IR treatment. Moreover, activation of Abl kinase activity by IR correlates well with activation of ATM activity in all phases of the cell cycle.

Enthalpy fluctuations of an arbitrarily chosen subsystem must be buffered by the remainder of the total system which serves as a heat reservoir. The magnitude of these fluctuations depends on the size of the reservoir. This leads to various interesting consequences for the physical behavior of the subsystem. As an example, we treat a lipid membrane with a phase transition that is embedded in an aqueous reservoir. We find that large fluctuations are attenuated when the reservoir has finite size. This has 	consequences	 for the compressibility of the membrane since volume and area fluctuations are also attenuated. We compare the equilibrium fluctuations of subsystems in finite reservoirs with those in periodically driven systems. In such systems, the subsystem has only finite time available to exchange heat with the surrounding medium. A larger frequency therefore reduces the volume of the accessible heat reservoir. Consequently, the fluctuations of the subsystem display a frequency dependence. While this work is of particular interest for a subsystem displaying a transition such as a lipid membrane, some of the results are of a generic nature and may contribute to

Leukemia differs substantially with respect to stromal milieu from tumors that progress locally as solid masses, and the physiological importance of immunosurveillance in leukemia remains unclear. However, currently available mouse leukemia models have critical limitations in the context of analyzing immunological regulation of leukemia development. In this study, we transferred mouse MLL/AF9 leukemia-initiating cells into immunocompetent recipient mice without any pre-conditioning such as irradiation, and then analyzed the spontaneous T cell response to an immunogenic antigen expressed in leukemia cells. When the minimum numbers of 	leukemia	-initiating cells for engraftment were transferred, leukemia cells were eradicated by the adaptive immune response in most, if not all, wild-type mice, but not in Rag2-/- recipient mice, which lack adaptive immunity.

In mice with advanced leukemia, antigen-specific CTLs were also expanded, but were unresponsive to antigen stimulation and expressed high levels of PD-1 and LAG-3.

Recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rG-CSF) is a glycoprotein hormone which has been produced in mammalian cells and, in a nonglycosylated form, in the bacterium Escherichia coli through recombinant DNA technology. It stimulates proliferation, differentiation and activation of cells of the neutrophil-granulocyte lineage and has been investigated as therapy for patients with various neutropenic conditions, both iatrogenic and disease related. rG-CSF is well tolerated, the most frequently reported adverse effect being mild to moderate bone pain. A major use for rG-CSF therapy will be in ameliorating the neutropenia which follows cytoreductive chemotherapy. rG-CSF accelerates neutrophil

The R353Q polymorphism of the FVII gene has been shown to modify plasma levels of FVII, and has in some studies also been associated with reduced risk for MI. OBJECTIVES: To examine the R353Q polymorphism of the FVII gene and the relation to myocardial infarction (MI), cardiovascular disease (CVD), and diabetes, and furthermore, to elucidate the association between the polymorphism and plasma levels of FVII coagulant activity (FVIIc), FVII antigen (FVIIag), activated FVII (FVIIa), and serum choline-containing phospholipids (PC).

Neuroblasts formation has usually ceased by the 16th week of gestation, while neuronal migration continues until the extinction of the germinal layer. At this time, the remnant of the germinal layer constitutes, between the thalami and the caudate nucleus, an eminence of tightly packed cells, called the ganglionic eminence or germinal zone.

We investigated the polarization states of macrophages in coronary atherectomy tissues retrieved from patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI, n = 52) or stable angina pectoris (SAP, n = 22). The specimens were analyzed immunohistochemically using antibodies specific to CD11c (M1 marker), CD206 (M2 marker), and to markers of endothelial cells, macrophages, and smooth muscle cells. Baseline characteristics were similar in the 2 groups. The proportion of areas immunopositive for alpha smooth muscle actin was similar, but those positive for 	CD31	 and CD68 were larger in the AMI group compared with the SAP group. In addition, AMI had significantly greater areas immunopositive for CD11c (P = .007) than did SAP, but CD206 (P = .102) positivity was not different in the 2 groups. In conclusion, M1 macrophage infiltration, not M2 macrophage infiltration, was increased in culprit plaques of patients with AMI.

Similar data were obtained in human aortic endothelial cell with NPR-C knockdown. NPR-C activation by C2238-alphaANP inhibited the protein kinase A/Akt1 pathway and increased reactive oxygen species. Adenovirus-mediated Akt1 reactivation rescued the detrimental effects of C2238-alphaANP. Overall, these data indicate that C2238-alphaANP affects endothelial cell integrity through NPR-C-dependent inhibition of the cAMP/protein kinase A/Akt1 pathway and increased reactive oxygen species production. Accordingly, C2238-alphaANP caused impairment of acetylcholine-dependent vasorelaxation ex vivo, which was rescued by 	NPR-C	 pharmacological inhibition. Finally, subjects carrying C2238 minor allele showed early endothelial dysfunction, which highlights the clinical relevance of our results. CONCLUSIONS: C2238-alphaANP reduces endothelial cell survival and impairs endothelial function through NPR-C signaling. NPR-C targeting represents a potential strategy to reduce cardiovascular risk in C2238 minor-allele carriers. DOCEND

After exposure, animals (n = 47) were euthanized, neocortical apoptotic neuronal cell death was quantified, and caspase 3 activity was compared between the four groups. RESULTS: The minimum alveolar concentration was determined to be 12.2% for desflurane, 2.7% for isoflurane, and 5.4% for sevoflurane.

Methods and results: Overexpression of Cbx3 led to a significant increase in VSMC contractile gene expression and VSMC apoptosis as well as a dramatic decrease in collagen gene expression, VSMC proliferation, and migration. Meanwhile, the opposite was observed following inhibition of endogenous Cbx3. Luciferase activity assays revealed that Notch signalling, but neither beta-catenin nor NF-kappaB signalling, is regulated by Cbx3 in VSMCs, and among the four Notch receptors, Notch3 is selectively down-regulated by Cbx3 through a transcriptional repression mechanism. Notch3 gene activation recapitulates the effects of Cbx3 knockdown on VSMC proliferation and migration. Consequently, the inhibitory effects of 	Cbx3	 over-expression on VSMC proliferation and migration were reversed by Notch3 gene reactivation. In a model of vascular damage by carotid wire injury, we observed that Cbx3 expression was dramatically down-regulated in the injured arteries. Local ectopic over-expression of Cbx3 in the injured arteries significantly inhibited Notch3 expression, thereby reducing VSMCs proliferation and causing an overall decrease in neointima formation. Additionally, injury-induced neointimal SMC hyperplasia was significantly reduced by aortic inhibition of Notch3. Importantly, a decreased expression level of Cbx3, but an increased expression level of Notch3, was observed in human femoral arteries with atherosclerotic lesions.

RESULTS: SEA-specific IgE antibodies in tears were positive in 	9 of 14 eyes	 in VKC patients and in 1 of 12 eyes in AKC patients. SEB-specific IgE antibodies in tears were positive in 7 of 14 eyes in VKC patients and in 2 of 12 eyes in AKC patients. Values for antibodies were higher in patients with severe clinical findings. However, all the cases in the normal control and the PAC groups were negative for both antibodies.

Immunodominant CD8(+) T cell responses against the B57-restricted epitopes comprised of residues 2629 to 2637 of nonstructural protein 5B (NS5B(2629-2637)) (KSKKTPMGF) and E2(541-549) (NTRPPLGNW) were recently shown to be crucial in the control of HCV infection. Here, we investigated whether the selection of deleterious cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) escape mutations in the NS5B KSKKTPMGF epitope might impair viral replication and contribute to the B57-mediated control of HCV. Common CTL escape mutations in this epitope were identified from a cohort of 374 	HCV	 genotype 1a-infected subjects, and their impact on HCV replication assessed using a transient HCV replicon system. We demonstrate that while escape mutations at residue 2633 (position 5) of the epitope had little or no impact on HCV replication in vitro, mutations at residue 2629 (position 1) substantially impaired replication. Notably, the deleterious mutations at position 2629 were tightly linked in vivo to upstream mutations at residue 2626, which functioned to restore the replicative defects imparted by the deleterious escape mutations. These data suggest that the selection of costly escape mutations within the immunodominant NS5B KSKKTPMGF epitope may contribute in part

Data were prospectively collected in a database of Emilia-Romagna region (Italy). RESULTS: Overall 30-day mortality was 9.3%. Stroke rate was 1.5%. At 1-, 3-, and 5-years overall mortality was 18.2%, 30.4%, and 42.2%, cardiac death rate was 3.9%, 9.2%, and 12.9%, stroke rate 2.5%, 7.7%, and 10.2%, re-operation occurrence 0.2%, 0.9% and 1.3%, and new pacemaker implantation was 2.3%, 5.1% and 7.8%. At multivariate analysis, urgency, hemodynamic instability, LVEF <=30%, NYHA III-IV, severe 	chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	 (COPD), extra-cardiac arteriopathy, cerebrovascular disease, and creatinine >2.0 mg/dL remained independent predictors of 5-year mortality. CONCLUSION: The results of the current study add weight to the evidence that traditional aortic valve replacement can be performed in high-risk patients with satisfactory 5-year mortality and morbidity. Our study may help to improve decision-making in this category of high-risk patients with aortic valve disease. DOCEND

Erythromycin did not effect esophageal body contraction amplitude or velocity, or the upper esophageal sphincter. Serum motilin decreased slightly after the administration of erythromycin. We concluded the following: (1) Erythromycin profoundly stimulates the defective LES in patients with GERD. This appears to be a direct motilin agonist-like effect rather than being mediated by release of endogenous motilin. (2) Erythromycin has less effect on the esophageal body, although it does prolong 	the duration of esophageal contractions	. DOCEND

The maximum production of pectinase, xylanase and alpha-amylase, and saccharification content (total soluble carbohydrates and reducing sugars) were obtained by application of the B. megatherium in SSF using wheat bran as compared to grasses, palm leaves and date seeds. All enzymes and saccharification content exhibited their maximum production during 12-24 h, at the range of 40-80% moisture content of wheat bran, temperature 37-45 degrees C and pH 5-8. An ascending repression of pectinase production was observed by carbon supplements of lactose, glucose, maltose, sucrose and starch, respectively. All carbon supplements improved the production of xylanase and alpha-amylase, except of 	lactose	 decreased alpha-amylase production. A little increase in the yield of total reducing sugars was detected for all carbon supplements. Among the nitrogen sources, yeast extract induced a significant repression to all enzyme productivity. Sodium nitrate, urea and ammonium chloride enhanced the production of xylanase, alpha-amylase and pectinase, respectively. Yeast extract, urea, ammonium sulphate and ammonium chloride enhanced the productivity of reducing sugars. CONCLUSIONS: The optimization of enzyme production and sccharification content by B. megatherium in SSF required only adjustment of incubation period and temperature, moisture content and initial pH.

In previous studies, we reported on a transgenic mouse model that develops melanoma spontaneously. Subsequent studies in these mice identified that the aberrant expression of metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (GRM1) in melanocytes played a critical role in the onset of melanoma. Confirmation of the etiologic role of GRM1 in melanoma development was shown in a second transgenic line with GRM1 expression under the regulation of a melanocyte-specific dopachrome tautomerase promoter. Ectopic expression of GRM1 was also detected in a subset of 	human	 melanoma cell lines and biopsies, suggesting that aberrant expression of GRM1 in melanocytes may contribute to the development of human melanoma. GRM1, a seven-transmembrane domain G protein-coupled receptor, is normally expressed and functional in neuronal cells, and its ligand, glutamate, is the major excitatory neurotransmitter. Human melanoma cells are shown here to release elevated levels of glutamate, implying a possible autocrine loop. Treatment of GRM1-expressing human melanoma cells with a GRM1 antagonist (LY367385 or BAY36-7620) or a glutamate release inhibitor (riluzole) leads to a suppression of cell proliferation as well as a decrease in levels of extracellular glutamate.

In an antimyeloperoxidase (anti-MPO) antibody-mediated disease model, mice transplanted with either gp91(phox)-deficient or p47(phox)-deficient bone marrow showed accelerated disease with increased crescents, necrosis, glomerular monocytes, and renal IL-1beta levels compared with mice transplanted with wild-type bone marrow. IL-1beta receptor blockade abrogated aggravated NCGN in gp91(phox)-deficient mice. In vitro, challenge with anti-MPO antibody strongly enhanced caspase-1 activity and 	IL-1beta	 generation in gp91(phox)-deficient and p47(phox)-deficient monocytes compared with wild-type monocytes. This enhanced IL-1beta generation was abrogated when caspase-1 was blocked. ANCA-induced superoxide and IL-1beta generation were inversely related in human monocytes. Furthermore, transplantation of gp91(phox)/caspase-1 double-deficient bone marrow rescued the accelerated NCGN phenotype in gp91(phox) bone marrow-deficient mice. These results suggest that Phox-generated reactive oxygen species downregulate caspase-1, thereby keeping the inflammasome in check and limiting ANCA-induced inflammation.

The EST sequence data were used to design 3800 SSR markers and consequently 630 polymorphic SSR loci and 213 reported marker loci have been mapped onto nine linkage groups, covering 1129.2 cM with an average distance of 1.3 cM between loci. Comparison of 	the mapped EST-SSR marker positions	 in R. sativus with the genome sequence of A. thaliana indicated that the Brassicaceae members have evolved from a common ancestor. It appears that genomic fragments corresponding to those of A. thaliana have been doubled and tripled in R. sativus. The genetic map developed here is expected to provide a standard map for the genetics, genomics, and molecular breeding of R. sativus as well as of related species.

BACKGROUND: Extreme telomere length has been previously reported to be associated with increased risk of gastric cancer. However, evidence from prospective studies on a relative large sample size with long-term follow-up to further corroborate previous study findings is meager. METHODS: The association between peripheral blood leukocyte telomere length and risk of gastric adenocarcinoma was prospectively examined in a cohort of 26,540 middle-aged or older Chinese nested in the Singapore Chinese Health Study. Telomere length was determined using a validated qPCR-based method. The Cox proportional regression method was used to estimate hazard ratio (HR) and its

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Microbiologic contamination of CT injector syringes over multiple uses for several injections was investigated in an experimental setup simulating the clinical setting. Each refill and injection operation was performed by the same technician, who processed a contrast agent for administration in a neighboring room as in clinical CT routine. Multiple administrations of nutritive medium and a chaser bolus were performed with the injection syringes. Simultaneously with each syringe replacement and filling operation, 	the filling	 and injection operation was simulated with a separate injection system under normal clinical conditions. Hygienic conditions in the CT department also were evaluated. For microbiologic analysis of devices and of palms of staff, imprints were obtained during clinical routine at the beginning of the study and at follow-up. Throughout the study, the staff participated in continuing education on hygienic behavior, such as hand disinfection and wearing of sterile gloves. In addition, clinical injector syringes were checked for microbiologic contamination.

During insulin stimulation, IRS-1 and IRS-2 strongly bound p85alpha/beta, which activated phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase, protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt, and p70(s6k), and promoted the phosphorylation of BAD. IRS-4 also promoted the activation of PKB/Akt and BAD phosphorylation during insulin stimulation; however, it weakly bound or activated p85-associated PI 3-kinase and failed to mediate the activation of p70(s6k). Insulin strongly inhibited apoptosis of interleukin-3 (IL-3)-deprived 32D(IR) cells expressing IRS-1 or IRS-2 but failed to inhibit apoptosis of cells expressing IRS-4. Consequently, 32D(IR) cells expressing IRS-4 proliferated slowly during insulin stimulation. Thus, 	the activation	 of PKB/Akt and BAD phosphorylation might not be sufficient to inhibit the apoptosis of IL-3-deprived 32D(IR) cells unless p85-associated PI 3-kinase or p70(s6k) are strongly activated.

The value of this approach, however, will ultimately depend on a clear demonstration, not yet available, that a change in therapy that increases primary tumor response will also lead to improved long-term survival. The roles of docetaxel and paclitaxel in the neoadjuvant setting has been actively investigated over the past 5 to 10 years, and exciting results are beginning to emerge. Clearly, docetaxel has potent antitumor activity against 	breast cancer	. Several preliminary results suggest that addition of docetaxel to an anthracycline-based regimen, particularly when added sequentially, as in NASBP B-27 and the Aberdeen trial, results in higher clinical and pathologic response rates. Whether this will translate into increased long-term survival, as suggested by the early results of the Aberdeen trial, remains to be seen. Whether sequential addition of docetaxel to doxorubicin is more or less effective than combining these drugs also has not been established. The results from M.D. Anderson suggesting that paclitaxel given on a weekly schedule was more effective than the same drug given every 3 weeks are

PURPOSE: The authors observed that eyes with acute fibrinous central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) masquerading active choroiditis had a "dark spot" within the yellow fibrinous deposit. The present study aims to describe this sign as a clinical indicator of acute serofibrinous exudative detachment, thus helping to differentiate it from active choroiditis. METHOD: The authors retrospectively reviewed the records of 19 patients of fibrinous CSC masquerading active choroiditis. Color fundus photographs, fundus fluorescein angiogram (	FFA	), and optical coherence tomography (OCT) at baseline and follow-up were studied for a dark spot. The systemic steroids were stopped and all patients were followed up. RESULTS: There were 12 men and 7 women with a mean age of 39.8 years. Fourteen patients had received systemic steroids. Funduscopy revealed creamy yellow subretinal lesion/s simulating active choroiditis lesion in all eyes and exudative retinal detachment in 9 eyes.

Heart rate did not change in either unclipped or sham-operated rats. Indomethacin (7 mg/kg) did not affect unclipping-induced changes in MAP, RBF, or urine output; however heart rate decreased immediately after unclipping and remained approximately 25-35 beats/min below control levels for the 2-h observation period. In rats lacking the extracorporeal circuit, MAP decreased (P less than 0.005) and heart rate increased (P less than 0.05) in response to unclipping. Nevertheless, unclipping-induced tachycardia was significantly less than that caused by 	nitroprusside	 infusions causing similar decrements in MAP. The results suggest that the sustained increment in RBF after unclipping in chronic, established 1K, 1C hypertension may be associated with postunclipping hypotension and diuresis, that blockade of prostaglandin synthesis may unmask unclipping-induced bradycardia, and that prostaglandins are not essential for postunclipping changes in renal hemodynamics.

We find that AhR negatively regulates class-switch recombination ex vivo by altering activation-induced cytidine deaminase expression. We further demonstrate that AhR suppresses class switching in vivo after influenza virus infection and immunization with model antigens. In addition, by regulating Blimp-1 expression via Bach2, AhR represses differentiation of B cells into plasmablasts ex vivo and antibody-secreting plasma cells in vivo. These experiments suggest that AhR serves as a molecular rheostat in B cells to brake the effector response, possibly to facilitate optimal recall responses.

The structures of the 88 ferredoxins with the CX4CX2CX29C pattern were modeled based on the available experimental structures of nine proteins within this same group. The modeling procedure was tested by building structural models for the ferredoxins with known structures. The models resulted, on 	average	, in being within 1 A of the backbone root-mean-square deviation from the corresponding experimental structures. In addition, these structural models were shown to be of high quality by using assessment procedures based on energetic and stereochemical parameters. Thus, these models formed a reliable structural database for this group of ferredoxins, which is meaningful within the framework of current structural genomics efforts. From the analysis of the structural database generated it was observed that the secondary structural elements and the overall three-dimensional structures are maintained throughout the superfamily.

To determine this, a morphine-tolerant state was induced by 10-day administration of an escalating dose of morphine from 10 to 40 mg/kg (s.c., b.i.d.), and lymphocyte proliferative response to a T-cell mitogen was measured. Morphine challenge (10 mg/kg s.c.) after days of treatment was gradually less immunosuppressive, and this tolerance progression was delayed by concurrent administration of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist (-)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine maleate (MK-801) (0.1 mg/kg s.c.) with chronic morphine. 	The effect	 was independent of glucocorticoid level changes and was not a result of an acute interaction of the drugs or the prolonged presence of the antagonist alone. Subsequent to chronic treatment, animals were subjected to opioid withdrawal and water stress. Both stressors induced 50% immunosuppression in morphine-tolerant animals compared with saline-treated controls. Increased immunological sensitivity to these stressors was attenuated when MK-801 was administered with chronic morphine as demonstrated by an accelerated recovery rate and lack of immunosuppression from opioid withdrawal and water stress, respectively.

Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), an inhibitor of NF-kappaB, was used to investigate the effect of NF-kappaB on hBD-2 expression. RESULTS: Mycoplasma genitalium-derived LAMPs induced the expressions of hBD-2 mRNA and protein in End1/E6E7 cells. The expressions could be abrogated by TLR2 and TLR6 neutralizing antibodies, or their dominant negative plasmids. In addition, dominant negative plasmids of MyD88 significantly decreased LAMPs-induced 	hBD-2	 expression. Western blotting showed that p65 was translocated to the nucleus, and the DNA binding activity of NF-kappaB was enhanced after LAMPs treatment.

The nutritional value of meat is an increasingly important factor influencing consumer preferences for poultry, red meat and processed meat products. Intramuscular fat content and composition, in addition to high quality protein, trace minerals and vitamins are important determinants of nutritional value. Fat content of meat at retail has decreased substantially over the past 40 years through advances in animal genetics, nutrition and management and changes in processing techniques. Evidence of the association between diet and the incidence of 	human	 non-communicable diseases has driven an interest in developing production systems for lowering total SFA and trans fatty acid (TFA) content and enrichment of n-3 PUFA concentrations in meat and meat products. Typically, poultry and pork has a lower fat content, containing higher PUFA and lower TFA concentrations than lamb or beef. Animal genetics, nutrition and maturity, coupled with their rumen microbiome, are the main factors influencing tissue lipid content and relative proportions of SFA, MUFA and PUFA.

Several genome studies have been undertaken in both cell models of NSCLC and clinical samples to identify alterations underlying disease behaviour, and many have identified recurring aberrations of chromosome 7. The presence of recurring chromosome 7 alterations that do not span the well-studied oncogenes EGFR (at 7p11.2) and MET (at 7q31.2) has raised the hypothesis of additional genes on this chromosome that contribute to tumourigenesis. In this study, we demonstrated that multiple loci on chromosome 7 are indeed amplified in 	NSCLC	, and through integrative analysis of gene dosage alterations and parallel gene expression changes, we identified new lung cancer oncogene candidates, including FTSJ2, NUDT1, TAF6, and POLR2J. Activation of these key genes was confirmed in panels of clinical lung tumour tissue as compared with matched normal lung tissue. The detection of gene activation in multiple cohorts of samples strongly supports the presence of key genes involved in lung cancer that are distinct from the EGFR and MET loci on chromosome 7.

Canrenone (0.5, 1, 2, and 5 mg/ml) produced a dose-dependent negative inotropic effect in papillary muscles contracting isometrically and blocked the positive inotropic effect produced by 660 microM ouabain. In Langendorff-perfused hearts beating spontaneously, a low concentration of canrenone (10 microg/ml) increased the isovolumic systolic pressure obtained at several diastolic pressures. Higher concentrations of canrenone (20, 30 microg/ml) brought the isovolumic pressure toward control values, and 100 microg/ml 	canrenone	 produced an isovolumic pressure reduction. In these preparations, 20 microg/ml canrenone reduced significantly the positive inotropic effects of 100 microM ouabain. Investigating the vascular smooth muscle reactivity to phenylephrine (PE; 0.5, 1, and 2 microg bolus injections) in the perfused rat-tail vascular bed, it was observed that canrenone blocked completely the enhancement of PE pressor effect produced by 1-h treatment with 100 microM ouabain. Similar results were obtained with the arterial blood pressure reactivity to PE in anesthetized rats.

The mechanism by which complement fragment C5a elevates intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) levels in two cell types, a monocytic cell line, U937, and neutrophils, has been investigated by the use of fluorometric and radiometric techniques. In U937 cells the influx of extracellular Ca2+ can be distinguished from the release of intracellular Ca2+ stores in terms of dose-responsiveness to C5a and sensitivity to pertussis-toxin poisoning. This suggests that the mechanism of Ca2+ influx in these cells is at least partially independent of both the production of inositol phosphates and elevation of internal Ca2+ concentration. The C5a-stimulated influx of 	45Ca2+	 into U937 cells is inhibited by a series of metal ions (Zn2+ > Co2+ > Mn2+ > Sr2+ approximately equal to Ni2+ > La3+). The stimulated influx of Ca2+ into neutrophils is inhibited differently (Ni2 >> Co2+ > Zn2+ approximately equal to La3+ > Mn2+ approximately equal to Sr2+), is less sensitive to C5a and both the influx of extracellular Ca2+ and the release of intracellular stores are equally sensitive to pertussis toxin treatment. Taken together these results indicate that [Ca2+]i is controlled in U937 monocytes by mechanisms distinct from those which appear to operate in other myeloid cells, such as neutrophils, stimulated with C5a and formylpeptide.

The present investigation describes for the first time the relation between beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2-M)-type amyloidosis and colocalized materials, as demonstrated using specific antibodies and hyaluronan-binding protein. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Amyloid-rich carpal tunnel synovium was obtained surgically from 28 patients who were being treated by maintenance hemodialysis. Serial sections were examined using a hyaluronan (hyaluronic acid)-binding protein and antibodies against heparan sulfate-glycosaminoglycan, chondroitin sulfate-proteoglycan, dermatan sulfate-proteoglycan, alpha 1-antichymotrypsin, alpha 1-antitrypsin, inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor, haptoglobin, and ubiquitin. RESULTS: Accumulation of hyaluronan was of three types, namely, localization around beta 2-M deposits, colocalization with deposition of 	beta 2-M	 itself and localization at a small distance from beta 2-M deposits. Immunostaining for heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan was demonstrated at the sites of beta 2-M plaques. Chondroitin sulfate-proteoglycan did not show specific patterns of immunostaining, resembling hyaluronan rather than heparan sulfate. The other materials tested, alpha 1-antichymotrypsin, alpha 1-antitrypsin, inter-alpha-trypsin, haptoglobin and ubiquitin, were not immunostained at sites of beta 2-M plaques. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting revealed that the molecular weight of heparan sulfate-glycosaminoglycan was 16,000. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that HS has an important role in hemodialysis-associated amyloidosis as it does in other types of amyloidosis. Moreover,

The genotoxicity caused by the microcystins LR and LA from a bloom collected in a eutrophic lake, was revealed in the fish Astyanaxbimaculatus, a native species from South America. LC50 (72 h) was determined as 242.81 mug L (-1) and LD50 (72 h) as 49.19 mug kg (-1) bw. There was a significant increase of DNA damage in peripheral erythrocytes, following intraperitoneal injection (ip) with tested concentrations of 24.58 mug kg (	-1	) bw and 36.88 mug kg (-1) bw, as well as through body exposure to a concentration of 103.72 mug L (-1) . Micronucleus (MN) induction was observed after ip injections of 24.58 mug kg (-1) bw and 36.88 mug kg (-1) bw for 72 h, as well as following body exposure for 72 at 103.72 mug L (-1) . Thus, both exposure routes resulted in MN induction and DNA damage. Apoptosis-necrosis testing was carried out only by ip injection with concentrations of 24.58 mug kg (-1) bw and 36.88 mug kg- 1 bw. Exposure to microcystins at lower concentrations induced more apoptosis

High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10, and 	tumor necrosis factor alpha	 (TNF-alpha) were measured in serum, and levels of mRNA gene expression of IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-alpha were analyzed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).

Experience refines synaptic connectivity through neural activity-dependent regulation of transcription factors. Although activity-dependent regulation of transcription factors has been well described, it is unknown whether synaptic activity and local, dendritic regulation of the induced transcripts are necessary for mammalian synaptic plasticity in response to transcription factor activation. Neuronal depolarization activates the myocyte enhancer factor 2 (	MEF2	) family of transcription factors that suppresses excitatory synapse number. We report that activation of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) on the dendrites, but not cell soma, of hippocampal CA1 neurons is required for MEF2-induced functional and structural synapse elimination. We present evidence that mGluR5 is necessary for synapse elimination to stimulate dendritic translation of the MEF2 target gene Arc/Arg3.1. Activity-regulated cytoskeletal-associated protein (Arc) is required for MEF2-induced synapse elimination, where it plays an acute, cell-autonomous, and postsynaptic role. This work reveals a role for dendritic activity in local translation of specific transcripts in synapse refinement. DOCEND

The regulated differentiation of macrophages (mphis) and their subsequent activation into proinflammatory or prohealing subtypes is critical for efficient wound healing. Chronic wounds such as diabetic (db) ulcers are associated with dysregulation of macrophage function. Whereas non-db mphis polarize to an M2-like, prohealing phenotype during the late stages of healing, db-derived mphis continue to display an M1-like, proinflammatory, or a mixed M1-like/M2-like phenotype. We have previously shown that sustained expression of Hoxa3 reduces the excessive number of leukocytes within the db wound; however, the effect of 	Hoxa3	 on mphi polarization was unknown. In this study, we show that Hoxa3 protein transduction of mphis in vitro enhances macrophage maturation, inhibits M1 polarization, and promotes M2 polarization, in part via regulation of Pu.1/Spi1 and Stat6. Sustained expression of Hoxa3 in vivo in db wounds reduces the number of Nos2(+) (M1-like) mphis, increases the number of Arg1(+) and VEGF(+) (M2-like) mphis, and accelerates healing in a DNA-binding independent manner. Our findings suggest a role for Hox protein activity in promoting M1-to-M2-like phenotypic switching via interactions with myeloid transcription factors and provide insight into mechanisms regulating this process in db wound

METHODS: Thirty-two patients were divided into two groups. single paclitaxel group (SPG): paclitaxel was only given to twelve untreated patients or those who had been given only one course of chemotherapy at a dose of 175 mg/m2 in 5% 	glucose	 500 ml, i.v. for 3 hours; and combined paclitaxel group (CPG): paclitaxel 135 mg/m2 in 5% glucose 55 ml, i.v. for 3 hours on day 1 plus cisplatin 70-80 mg/m2 or carboplatin 300 mg/m2, i.v. on day 2, was administered to 20 patients with persistent or recurrent tumor after platinum based chemotherapy.

Attempts to induce acute rejection of permanently accepted grafts, by injection of presensitized spleen cells, were successful only if the tolerant recipients had been pretreated with cyclophosphamide. Tolerance against second allografts from the primary donor strain could not be abrogated by injection of presensitized cells shortly after grafting. After removal of the permanently accepted graft, the tolerant recipients regained their capacity for acute rejection within 100 days. Tolerance was adoptively transferred with spleen cells, obtained from tolerant rats, to syngeneic sublethally irradiated recipients. The transferred unresponsiveness was donor-specific, antigen-dependent, and could again be transferred to irradiated recipients. 	The transferred suppression	 was abolished by the addition of presensitized, but not by naive, syngeneic spleen cells. The results indicate that donor-specific, antigen-dependent suppressor cells are essential for the maintenance of ATG-induced allograft acceptance. The suppression may influence the generation and activation, as well as the function, of alloreactive cells. DOCEND

Luminance contrast and color contrast of the stimuli were set with a chromatic substitution technique. In 	Experiment 1	, the perceived duration of both chromatic stimuli and achromatic stimuli increased as the luminance contrast decreased. Experiment 2 tested if the duration of the percept was influenced by color contrast which was defined by colorimetric purity of the stimuli, when luminance contrast was set as low as practically possible.

A total of 32.5% of subjects had clinically significant NA with treatment based on review of serum immunosuppressant levels. NA was found to be significantly related to acute and chronic rejection, and graft loss (	p < 0.001	). NA was also related to the presence of comorbid psychiatric illness (p < 0.001). Logistic regression indicated that NA was a significant predictor for acute and chronic rejection, while psychiatric illness predicted graft loss. Adolescents had significantly higher rates of NA as well as shorter intervals between transplant date and onset of NA when compared with child patients (p < 0.001). Physician ratings of the primary reasons for NA suggested that lack of parental supervision and parent-child conflict were the major factors related to NA. DOCEND

Univentricular survival predictions were generated using the Congenital Heart Surgeons' Society Univentricular Repair Survival Advantage score. RESULTS: One half of survivors required reintervention within 3 years. The risk of undergoing early reintervention decreased with successive procedures (P<.0001); however, second (n=27) and third (n=8) reinterventions were associated with a greater late risk of repeat reintervention compared with the index procedure (P=.02). The morphologic risk factors for earlier reintervention included left ventricular dysfunction, fewer aortic cusps, associated subaortic or arch obstruction, and a larger tricuspid annulus. 	The risk	 of death did not improve after successive reinterventions. Therefore, the overall survival for those requiring repeated reinterventions was compromised by the cumulative procedural risk of death. The most important risk factor for death after the first reintervention (P<.01) was a shorter interval from the index biventricular procedure, particularly if less than 30 days. Fifteen neonates required reintervention within 30 days of the index biventricular procedure (9 deaths, 60%). For the same 15 neonates, the survival predictions using published models estimated fewer than one half the number deaths with index univentricular repair strategies (4/15, 27%, P=.03).

These cases also had the highest total occlusal score according to the numerical classification, while the total occlusal score after one periosteoplasty in patients with less wider clefts was smaller than in the controls. In all patients who had undergone 	periosteoplasty new bone	 formed within the alveolar cleft.

A second-derivative scan of an acidified urine sample allows the amplitude of deflection (delta A) and the minimum wavelength of the trough (lambda min) to determine the correct porphyrin concentration and the coproporphyrin:uroporphyrin (copro:uro) ratio, respectively, from a nomogram constructed from calibrator solutions. We measured 24 urine samples for total porphyrin as coproporphyrin equivalents and adjusted the results with factors from the nomogram. The adjusted results (x) (mean +/- SE, 501 +/- 57 nmol/L) compared favorably with the expected results (y) (514 +/- 57). 	The regression equation and correlation coefficient	 were: y = 0.993x - 8.9 (r = 0.998, S(y/x) = 16.2). Results of the copro:uro ratio derived by second-derivative spectroscopy and HPLC showed no significant difference (chi 2-test) from samples with various copro:uro ratios. Recovery studies on four urine samples supplemented with known proportions of coproporphyrins and uroporphyrins gave good agreement between the measured and the expected porphyrin ratios. The overall imprecision (CV) of the assay ranged from 3.6% to 6.0% for coproporphyrin and from 3.2% to 9.1% for uroporphyrin. DOCEND

Phorbol12-myristate13-acetate (PMA) was used to induce human acute mononuclear leukemia cells THP-1 to differentiate into macrophages. The THP-1-derived macrophages were stimulated by soluble egg antigen (SEA), and the culture supernatants were collected for detection of activation of macrophages. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) was used to detect the cytotoxicity of the culture supernatant and PTX on the LX-2 cells. The LX-2 cells were administered with activated culture supernatant from macrophages and(or) PTX to detect the transforming growth factor-beta gene expression. The mRNA expression of shh and 	gli-1	, key parts in HH signaling pathway, was detected. The mRNA expression of shh and gli-1 was increased in LX-2 cells treated with activated macrophages-derived culture supernatant, suggesting HH signaling pathway may play a key role in the activation process of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). The expression of these genes decreased in LX-2 cells co-cultured with both activated macrophages-derived culture supernatant and PTX, indicating PTX could suppress the activation process of HSCs. In conclusion, these data provide evidence that PTX prevents liver fibrogenesis in vitro by the suppression of HH signaling pathway. DOCEND

PURPOSE: To evaluate putative mechanisms for the pleiotropic effects of statins, the expression of members of the heat shock family of proteins (HSPs) was compared between normal and ischemic rat retinas after transient retinal ischemia/reperfusion and statin treatment in vivo. METHODS: Retinal ischemia/reperfusion was induced by transient elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP). Retinal expression of HSPs was evaluated at different time points after drug and solvent injection and retinal ischemia/reperfusion by means of PCR and Western blot analysis. Immunofluorescent staining and confocal laser scanning microscopy were used to localize 	the expression	 of HSPs in normal and ischemic retinas. RESULTS: During the acute phase after retinal ischemia, alphaB-crystallin protein and mRNA expression were reduced after statin treatment. After 72 hours of reperfusion, statins increased the expression of alphaB-crystallin and reduced the expression of HSP27 in the retina. Increased expression of alphaB-crystallin early after lesion and statin delivery correlated with increased expression of the heat shock factors 1 and 2. Statins significantly enhanced retinal ganglion cell (RGC) survival 10 days after transient retinal ischemia in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Systemic delivery of statins after a transient period of retinal ischemia significantly modulated HSP expression in

To this end we investigated whether subjects with preclinical AD could be differentiated from subjects with nonprogressive mild cognitive impairment and from subjects with very mild AD-type dementia. METHODS: Twenty-three subjects with preclinical AD, 44 subjects with nonprogressive mild cognitive impairment, and 25 subjects with very mild AD-type dementia were selected from a memory clinic population. 	Variables	 that were used to differentiate the groups were demographic variables, the Mini-Mental State Examination score, performance on cognitive tests, measures of functional impairment, and measures of noncognitive symptomatology. RESULTS: Age and the scores for the delayed recall task could best discriminate between subjects with preclinical AD and subjects with nonprogressive mild cognitive impairment. The overall accuracy was 87%. The score on the Global Deterioration Scale and a measure of intelligence could best discriminate between subjects with preclinical AD and subjects with very mild AD-type dementia. The overall accuracy was 85%. CONCLUSIONS: Subjects with preclinical AD can be distinguished from subjects

Retinopathy of prematurity is a sight-threatening complication of premature birth caused by nitro-oxidative insult to the developing retinal vasculature during therapeutic hyperoxia exposure and later ischemia-induced neovascularization on supplemental oxygen withdrawal. In the vasodegenerative phase, during hyperoxia, defective endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS) produces reactive 	oxygen	 and nitrogen free radicals rather than vasoprotective nitric oxide for unclear reasons. Crucially, normal NOS function depends on availability of the cofactor (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). Because BH4 synthesis is controlled enzymatically by GTP cyclohydrolase (GTPCH), we used GTPCH-depleted mice [hyperphenylalaninemia strain (hph1)] to investigate the impact of hyperoxia on BH4 bioavailability and retinal vascular pathology in the neonate. Hyperoxia decreased BH4 in retinas, lungs, and aortas in all experimental groups, resulting in a dose-dependent decrease in NOS activity and, in the wild-type group, elevated NOS-derived superoxide. Retinal dopamine levels were similarly diminished, consistent with the dependence of tyrosine hydroxylase on BH4.

In preventive treatment studies, SD-169 significantly reduced p38 and HSP60 expression in T cells of the pancreatic beta islets. Following treatment, the incidence of diabetes as determined by blood glucose levels was significantly lower, and immuno-histochemistry of pancreatic beta islet tissue demonstrated significant reduction in CD5+ T cell infiltration in the SD-169 treatment group as compared with untreated NOD mice. In therapeutic studies using mildly and moderately hyperglycemic NOD mice, SD-169 treatment lowered blood 	glucose	 and improved glucose homeostasis. Furthermore, following cessation of SD-169 treatment, NOD mice showed significant arrest of diabetes. In conclusion, we report that this p38alpha-selective inhibitor prevents the development and progression of diabetes in NOD mice by inhibiting T cell infiltration and activation, thereby preserving beta cell mass via inhibition of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. These results have bearing on current prophylactic and therapeutic protocols using p38alpha-selective inhibitors in the prediabetic period for children at high risk of type 1 diabetes, in the honeymoon period, and for adults with latent autoimmune diabetes.

In this study we examined the capacity of alphaB-crystallin or peptides derived thereof to induce experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in SJL mice. Despite extensive efforts to induce EAE using active immunization with whole alphaB-crystallin, using adoptive transfer of lymphocytes or using peptide immunizations, no clinical or histological signs of EAE could be induced. SJL mice were unable to mount proliferative T-cell responses in vitro or delayed-type hypersensitivity responses in vivo to self-alphaB-crystallin. Also, immunization with self-	alphaB-crystallin	 did not lead to any antibody response in SJL mice while bovine alphaB-crystallin triggered clear antibody responses within 1 week. Immunizations with alphaB-crystallin-derived peptides led to the activation of IL-4-producing Th2 cells and only a few IFN-gamma-producing Th1 cells. Peptide-specific T cells showed no cross-reactivity against whole alphaB-crystallin. The inability of SJL mice to mount proinflammatory T-cell responses against self-alphaB-crystallin readily explains the lack of EAE induction by immunization with whole protein or peptides derived from it.

Streptozotocin-treated diabetic animals that received daily insulin supplementation or those that had undergone pancreas transplantation shortly after induction of diabetes showed a similar reduction in blood glucose levels and normal rates of gastric emptying. Diabetes had a significant but variable effect on gastric mass and body weight. This response was dependent on the strain of animal examined, whether or not insulin supplementation was administered, or whether the animal underwent pancreas transplantation. These observations indicate that early 	diabetes	 in rodents has a prokinetic effect on gastric emptying of a suspended solid digestible meal. Restoration of euglycemia by insulin treatment or pancreas transplantation is associated with return of the gastric emptying rate to normal.

Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis revealed that the differential expression of BAX, BCL2, and caspase 3 genes, specific in rAd-p53-induced apoptotic cells, was not altered in rAd-p21-induced apoptotic cells, suggesting p21(WAF1/CIP1)-induced apoptosis through a pathway distinguishable from p53-induced apoptosis. Expression analysis of 2774qw1 cells infected with rAd-p21 on 60,000 cDNA microarrays identified 159 genes in response to p21(WAF1/CIP1) expression in at least one time point with 2.5-fold change as a cutoff. Integration of the data with the parallel microarray experiments with rAd-p53 infection allowed us to 	extract 66 genes	 downstream of both p53 and p21(WAF1/CIP1) and 93 genes in response to p21(WAF1/CIP1) expression in a p53-independent pathway. The genes in the former set may play a dual role in both p53-dependent and p53-independent pathways, and the genes in the latter set gave a mechanistic molecular explanation for p53-independent p21(WAF1/CIP1)-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, promoter sequence analysis suggested that transcription factor E2F family is partially responsible for the differential expression of genes following p21(WAF1/CIP1). This study has profound significance toward understanding the role of p21(WAF1/CIP1) in p53-independent apoptosis. DOCEND
16261158	T6	ggp	DOCSTART Multiple alternate p21 transcripts are regulated by p53 in human cells. The p53 tumor-suppressor is a transcription factor that is stabilized in response to cellular stress leading to growth arrest or apoptosis. p21(	WAF1	/CIP1) is a major transcriptional target of p53 and it plays a critical role in p53-dependent cell cycle arrest. In this study, we identified multiple alternate human p21 transcripts that have their transcriptional start sites in the direct proximity of the distal p53 response element. These transcripts are upregulated as a result of DNA damage-induced p53 activation. Furthermore, the basal expression of these alternate transcripts is strongly regulated by p53 and they are undetectable in p53-knocked down cells. This is in contrast to classical p21 transcripts, which have reduced, albeit detectable expression levels in the absence of p53. The existence

RESULTS: A novel missense mutation (1454C > A) in exon 3 of the AVPR2 gene predicting a Ser329Arg substitution was identified in the X-chromosome of the two affected brothers and in one of the X-chromosomes in the mother. The AVPR2 gene was normal in two unaffected siblings. Under basal conditions, the 24-h urine volumes of the two affected boys were 5.5 l (229 ml/kg) and 3.5 l (192 ml/kg), the urine osmolalities were 	78 and 90 mosm/kg	, and plasma AVP 13.5 and 19.0 pg/ml. Urine osmolalities increased to 573 and 720 mosm/kg while plasma AVP levels were practically unchanged, 13.6 and 8.8 pg/ml, during fluid deprivation. Infusion of AVP resulted in urine osmolalities of 523 and 623 mosm/kg at plasma AVP levels of 58 and 42 pg/ml. Infusion of dDAVP had a similar effect, while treatment with standard doses of intranasal dDAVP had no effect on urine output.

Neomycin (10 microM - 1 mM) was found to induce considerable release of [3H]arachidonic acid from phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine in saponin-permeabilized human platelets prelabeled with [3H]arachidonic acid. The magnitude of arachidonate liberation was almost equal to that induced by 	A23187	 (400 nM) or even greater than that caused by thrombin (1 U/ml). Moreover, neomycin enhanced arachidonic acid release induced by thrombin. Since no significant formation of diacylglycerol and phosphatidic acid via phospholipase C was observed, the arachidonate liberation was considered to be mainly catalyzed by phospholipase A2 action. Addition of neomycin (100 microM) to 45Ca2+-preloaded platelets elicited 45Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores. These results indicate evidence that neomycin evokes Ca2+ mobilization from internal stores, which leads to activation of phospholipase A2 to release arachidonic acid in human platelets. DOCEND

Concurrently, measurement was also made of [Ca2+]i in the nylon-wool-enriched resting T-cells induced by Con A and in Con-A-activated blast T-cells induced by rIL2. Our results showed that [Ca2+]i increases were seen in the splenic T-cells from three different groups of mice following Con A, but not rIL2 stimulation. However, this increase was much smaller in the splenic T-cells from ethanol-fed mice as compared to mice on maltose- or standard-diet. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that the impaired [Ca2+]i increase was seen in the T-cells of the same ethanol-fed 	mice	 having decreased the proliferative response to Con A. This reduced proliferation did not result from the presence of excessive suppressor T-cell activity. Finally, we also demonstrated that both the number of IL2 binding sites/cell and the Kd values of the low- and high-affinity IL2R on the T-cells from ethanol-fed mice were unaltered. Because evidence indicates that (1) a normal level of [Ca2+]i increase is a prerequisite for the production of IL2 by mitogen-stimulated T-cells, and (2) T-cells from ethanol-fed mice have normal capacities to produce IL2 that is the crucial growth factor controlling T-cells to progress through the cell cycle,

Therefore, the two types of nucleases appear to exert preferential effects on the different types of microtubule initiation sites in mitotic mammalian cells. The results suggest that DNA is a major component of the kinetochore, while RNA is a major component of the amorphous pericentriolar material.

African green monkey kidney (AGMK) cells were nonpermissive hosts for type 2 adenovirus although the restriction was not complete; when only 3 plaque-forming units/cell was employed as the inoculum, the viral yield was about 0.1% of 	the maximum virus	 produced when simian virus 40 (SV40) enhanced adenovirus multiplication. The viral yield of cells infected only with type 2 adenovirus increased as the multiplicity of infection was increased. Type 2 adenovirus could infect almost all AGMK cells in culture; adenovirus-specific early proteins and DNA were synthesized in most cells, but small amounts of late proteins were made in relatively few cells. Even when cells were infected with both SV40 and adenovirus, only about 50% were permissive for synthesis of adenovirus capsid proteins.

In this context, the effects of IL-33 are mostly anti-inflammatory. However, depending on the actual cytokine and cellular milieu, IL-33 can promote both Th1 and Th2 immune reactions. Most importantly for cardiology and cardiac surgery, IL-33 has emerged to represent the as yet unknown ligand of the orphan receptor ST2. Before the advent of IL-33, the ST2 receptor, currently recognized as the soluble one of its two isoforms, was considered to be an unfavorable prognostic marker in 	myocardial infarction	, congestive heart failure and trauma/sepsis shock patients. Now we know that IL-33, when bound to the cellular membrane-anchored ST2L isoform of the receptor, can have certain beneficial effects on the aforementioned conditions. Various forms of IL-33 interaction with the respective isoforms of its cognate receptor are discussed here. The focus is on physiological and prognostic values in cardiac patients. DOCEND

Of the 110 knees, 90 were evaluated by postoperative MRI alone, 2 by second-look arthroscopy alone, and 18 by both. Magnetic resonance imaging showed 12 gross tears and 6 small tears in the allograft. Mean extrusion of the allograft was 3.7 mm, and mean relative percentage of extrusion was 42.6%. Second-look arthroscopy showed 6 gross tears and 1 small flap tear. Classification by clinical outcome, 	MRI	, and second-look arthroscopy graded 90 allografts (81.8%) as satisfactory, 8 (7.3%) as fair, and 12 (10.9%) as poor. CONCLUSION: Meniscus allograft transplantation using bone fixation resulted in significant symptomatic and functional improvements. Magnetic resonance imaging or second-look arthroscopy was necessary to assess allograft status even after favorable clinical outcome.

Photodegradation of folates may have played a role in the development of different 	human	 skin colours. 5MTHF can be degraded directly by exposure to ultraviolet radiation or by exposure to visible light in the presence of endogenous sensitizers like riboflavin (RF). These photochemical reactions were studied by absorption spectroscopy. While 5MTHF is stable under UV and visible light exposure in pure aqueous media, it is quickly degraded in the presence of RF during UVA and blue light exposure. The degradation of 5MTHF is dependent on the concentration of RF, but not on the concentration of 5MTHF itself. UVA and blue light gave similar reactions.

The first examined the effects of a single inhalation exposure to concentrated ambient PM(2.5) (CAPS) from New York City air on pulmonary/systemic immunity and on the susceptibility of exposed aged rats to subsequent infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae. The second set of studies determined whether CAPS exposure, at a concentration approximating or somewhat greater than the promulgated 24-h NAAQS of 65 microg/m(3), could exacerbate an ongoing infection. Taken together, results demonstrated that a single exposure of healthy animals to CAPS had little effect on pulmonary immune function or bacterial clearance during subsequent challenge with 	S. pneumoniae	. Alternatively, CAPS exposure of previously infected rats significantly increased bacterial burdens and decreased percentages of lavageable neutrophils and proinflammatory cytokine levels compared to those in infected filtered-air-exposed controls. These studies demonstrate that a single exposure to ambient PM(2.5) compromises a host's ability to handle ongoing pneumococcal infections and support the epidemiological findings of increased pneumonia-related deaths in ambient PM-exposed elderly individuals.

A total of 43 and 48 polymorphic bands were amplified by ISSR and DAMD markers, respectively. Average polymorphism information content (PIC) for ISSR and DAMD markers were 0.37 and 0.41, respectively. All 31 lentil genotypes could be distinguished by ISSR markers into 	three groups	 and by DAMD markers into two groups. Various molecular markers show a different efficiency for evaluating DNA polymorphism in lentil and indicate that the patterns of variation are clearly influenced by the genetic marker used. Comparatively, the genetic diversity of examined lentil genotypes by two different marker techniques (ISSR and DAMD) was high and indicated that ISSR and DAMD are effective and promising marker systems for fingerprinting in lentil and give useful information on its genetic relationships.

Coumarins are important plant secondary metabolites with a variety of biological activities. Ortho-hydroxylation of cinnamates leads to the formation of coumarin lactone ring and is generally thought to be a key step in coumarin biosynthesis. However, ortho-hydroxylases, especially p-coumaroyl CoA 2'-hydroxylase (C2'H) responsible for the biosynthesis of the most common coumarin skeleton, have received insufficient attention.

Their different bioactivity for decorporation of (234)Th was consistent with their competitive ability to mobilize thorium with BSA. Although the removal effectiveness of 9501 and 7601, given by delayed injection, was lower than that of the prompt administration, they could inhibit (234)Th-induced lipid peroxidation. This caused significant reductions of MDA content in bone marrow and liver and markedly ameliorated histological changes to bone marrow and liver tissue in (234)Th-treated mice.

The inhibition was dose-dependent and was coupled to an inhibition of the cyclic GMP production activated by L-arginine. Results also show that calmodulin appears to be involved in this process because its presence in the incubation medium was able to prevent the effect of melatonin on both NOS activity and cyclic GMP production.

Accordingly, QSAR analysis has long been a mainstay of compound optimization efforts. However, the strong compound class dependence of SAR features and their intrinsic heterogeneity often pose severe constraints on the applicability of these methods. In addition to QSAR approaches, conceptually different molecular similarity methods are also applied to identify novel active compounds. In order to complement and further extend the current repertoire of computational methods, SAR analysis functions have recently been introduced that evaluate and compare 	SAR features	 on a large scale, extract SAR information from compound data sets and prioritize SARs that are promising targets for optimization. SAR analysis functions are designed to systematically profile and compare SARs contained in different data sets and characterize both global and local SAR features.

Cox proportional-hazards models were used to assess association of comorbidities and medications with survival. During 38,800 and 127,419 person-years for 1970 to 1974 and 1990 to 1994, respectively, 387 and 1555 confirmed incident cases were identified. When adjusted for age, incidence increased by 14% (95% CI 2% to 28%). 	Increased incidence	 tended to be greater for older persons and for men. Based on 5-year follow-up and adjustment for age and comorbidities, the mortality hazards decreased 33% (95% CI 14% to 48%) among men and 24% (95% CI -1% to 43%) among women. CONCLUSIONS: The epidemic increase in HF among the older population between the 1970s and 1990s is associated with increased incidence and improved survival, with both of these effects being greater in men.

METHODS: Fifteen cases of 	basal cell carcinoma	 (BCC), 12 cases of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and five cases of keratoacanthoma (KA) were analysed by immunohistochemistry on paraffin-embedded sections using anti-ERBIN and anti-Erb-B2 antibodies. RESULTS: ERBIN and Erb-B2 had a similar distribution in normal human skin. They were primarily localized at the plasma membrane in differentiated keratinocytes and in duct cells from eccrine glands, whereas they were localized diffusely in the cytoplasma of basal keratinocytes. In both SCC and KA the subcellular distribution of ERBIN and Erb-B2 remained unchanged, whereas both proteins were redistributed from the plasma membrane into cytosolic aggregates in BCC.

BACKGROUND: The role of Mycoplasma hominis and M. genitalium in urogenital tract infections remains unknown. Furthermore these mollicutes present a complex relationship with the host immune response. The role of inflammatory cytokines in infections also makes them good candidates to investigate bacterial vaginosis and 	mycoplasma	 genital infections. Therefore, the aim of this study was to detect the above-mentioned mollicutes by quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) methodologies in vaginal swabs and dosage of cytokines. METHODS: Vaginal swabs and peripheral blood were collected from 302 women, including healthy individuals. The molecular findings were correlated with some individual behavioral variables, clinical and demographic characteristics, presence of other important microorganisms in vaginal swabs, and levels of interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-6. RESULTS: M. hominis and M. genitalium were detected in 31.8% and 28.1% of samples, respectively. The qPCR results were associated with clinical signs and symptoms of the infections studied.

Project DIRECT consisted of a comprehensive program aimed at reducing the burden of diabetes in the vulnerable high-risk African-American population of southeast Raleigh, NC. Forty-seven providers caring for this target population of adult diabetes patients were included in this quasi-experimental study. At the initial session, providers learned about the CQIP components, completed a planning worksheet, and chose a CQIP coordinator. Educational events included continuing education in practices and through conferences by experts, and guideline distribution. Follow-up was accomplished through phone calls and visits. Effectiveness was measured by 	a change	 in prevalence of selected patterns of care abstracted from 1,006 medical charts. Appropriate statistical methods were used to account for the cluster design and repeated measures. At the fourth follow-up year, approximately 40% of providers still participated in the program. Among the providers who stayed in the program for the whole study period, most selected quality care patterns showed significant upward trends. Glycemic control indicators did not change, however, despite an increased number of hemoglobin A1c tests per year. A diabetes CQI program can be effectively implemented in a community setting. Improved performance measures were not associated with improved outcomes.

New knowledge regarding the pathophysiology confirms changes in the motility of the gallbladder and the flow dynamics and lithogenicity of the bile. 	The studies	 have also shown, that these changes resolve completely after labour, which might explain the disappearance of most of the gallstones. These conditions support a conservative attitude towards treatment of gallstone disease during pregnancy.

IkappaB kinase epsilon (IKKepsilon, IKBKE) is a key regulator of innate immunity and a breast cancer oncogene, amplified in ~30% of breast cancers, that promotes malignant transformation through NF-kappaB activation. Here, we show that IKKepsilon is modified and regulated by 	K63-linked polyubiquitination	 at lysine 30 and lysine 401. Tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-1beta stimulation induces IKKepsilon K63-linked polyubiquitination over baseline levels in both macrophages and breast cancer cell lines, and this modification is essential for IKKepsilon kinase activity, IKKepsilon-mediated NF-kappaB activation, and IKKepsilon-induced malignant transformation. Disruption of K63-linked ubiquitination of IKKepsilon does not affect its overall structure but impairs the recruitment of canonical NF-kappaB proteins. A cIAP1/cIAP2/TRAF2 E3 ligase complex binds to and ubiquitinates IKKepsilon. Altogether, these observations demonstrate that K63-linked polyubiquitination regulates IKKepsilon activity in both inflammatory and oncogenic contexts and suggests an alternative approach to targeting this breast cancer

Multiple mechanisms have been suggested to be responsible for the insulinotropic and blood glucose lowering effects of imidazoline compounds. This study was to unravel which mechanism predominantly accounts for glucose lowering by the prototypical imidazolines idazoxan and phentolamine. To this end, an alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist (UK14,304) and a KATP channel opener (diazoxide) were used to inhibit insulin release from isolated perifused 	mouse	 islets and to induce hyperglycaemia in conscious mice. Potentials of idazoxan and phentolamine to counteract these effects were examined in a comparative manner. In perifused islets, idazoxan increased insulin release only in the presence of the alpha2-agonist, whereas phentolamine strongly counteracted both inhibitors of insulin release. In vivo, a lower dose of idazoxan was necessary to ameliorate hyperglycaemia induced by the alpha2-agonist than by the KATP channel opener, indicating alpha2A-antagonism as the predominant mechanism of action (decrease in incremental area under the glucose curve induced by 0.1mg/kg idazoxan: under diazoxide, -3+/-7%, vs. under UK14,304, -34+/-9%, P<0.02).

Th9 cells regulate multiple immune responses, including immunity to pathogens and tumors, allergic inflammation, and autoimmunity. Despite ongoing research into Th9 development and function, little is known about the stability of the Th9 phenotype. In this study, we demonstrate that IL-9 production is progressively lost in Th9 cultures during several rounds of differentiation. The loss of IL-9 is not due to an outgrowth of cells that do not secrete IL-9, as purified IL-9 secretors demonstrate the same loss of IL-9 in subsequent rounds of differentiation. The loss of 	IL-9	 production correlates with increases in phospho-STAT3 levels within the cell, as well as the production of IL-10. STAT3-deficient Th9 cells have increased IL-9 production that is maintained for longer in culture than IL-9 in control cultures. IL-10 is responsible for STAT3 activation during the first round of differentiation, and it contributes to instability in subsequent rounds of culture. Taken together, our results indicate that environmental cues dictate the instability of the Th9 phenotype, and they suggest approaches to enhance Th9 activity in beneficial immune responses. DOCEND

In one such bone tissue, the O2 consumption was measured by analyzing the decrease in the partial pressure of oxygen (Po2) in a closed chamber containing calvarial fragments from adult guinea pigs (250-400 g) or from neonatal rats and guinea pigs. The O2 consumption of fragments from adult guinea pigs amounted to 0.05, 0.066, and 0.095 ml/100 g* minute at 24, 27, and 36.5 degrees C, respectively. When the temperature exceeded 43 degrees C, O2 consumption irreversibly stopped. Both 	antimycin A	 and rotenone, which block the respiratory chain, reduced O2 consumption to approximately 20% of control values. O2 consumption was significantly higher in neonatal animals (0.369 ml/100 g* minute at 27 degrees C) and could be blocked completely by antimycin A. On the basis of the high consumption of O2 by bone cells, we hypothesize that specialized transport systems, i.e., gap junctions, are required to provide a sufficient supply of nutrients to cells in osseous tissue.

In the present study, the correlation of APN and its multimers with myeloperoxidase (MPO), an enzyme with pro-inflammatory properties, was examined in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. MPO and APN serum levels were assessed in 49 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus at the beginning and at the end of an anti-diabetic treatment. After treatment 	a significant increase	 in the ratio of HMW to total APN (from 0.43+/-0.16 to 0.59+/-0.14, p<0.05) was found. Before treatment, HMW-APN was correlated positively with MPO (r=0.314, p<0.05). Moreover, a positive correlation was observed between the increased HMW ratio and MPO during treatment (r=0.304, p<0.05). HMW-APN correlates positively with MPO in patients with type 2 diabetes.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate this assay system in clinical routine based on an international multicentre trial and to compare the results with other established TRAb assays. PATIENTS AND MEASUREMENTS: Totally 508 Graves' disease (GD), 142 autoimmune thyroiditis, 107 subacute thyroiditis, 109 nonautoimmune nodular goitre, 23 	thyroid cancer	 patients and 446 normal controls were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS: ROC plot analysis revealed an area under curve of 0.99 (95% CI: 0.99-1.0) indicating a high assay sensitivity and specificity. The highest sensitivity (99%) and specificity (99%) was seen at a cut-off level of 1.75 IU/l. Here, the calculated positive predictive value was 95%, whereas the negative predictive value was 100%.

Furthermore, an unrelated donor with the granzyme B +55 variant genotype (AA) was an independent risk factor for development of grades II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (P=0.024, RR=1.811). Among patients with acute myelogenous leukemia, those with the Fas -670 TT genotype were at higher risk of relapse (P=0.003, RR=3.823).

Addition of fly ash, which contained high levels of Ca and Cl, to NaCl impregnated-newspaper increased total dioxin formation from 80.8 ngg(-1) to 139 ngg(-1) during combustion.

The strict dependence of the NMDA-evoked response on extracellular Ca2+ provides little evidence for a coupling of 	NMDA	 receptors to inositol phosphate metabolism and mobilization of intracellular Ca2+. The effect of various agents on NMDA/glycine-induced increases in [Ca2+]i parallels their effects on ligand binding to or current flow through the NMDA receptor-channel complex. The measurement of cytosolic Ca2+ in this preparation of neuronal cells thus appears especially well suited for assessing, on a functional level, the regulation of NMDA receptors in the CNS. DOCEND

Classic diagnostics, such as electrophoresis and quantitative Ig measurement proved futile to detect LC-progression, whereas SFLCs were reliable markers. The LCE-MM prevalence within 407 MM patients treated in our institution between 2004 and 2007 was 2.46%.

11056520	T15	ggp	DOCSTART PYK2 is an adhesion kinase in macrophages, localized in podosomes and activated by beta(2)-integrin ligation. Pyk2 is a member of the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) family, highly expressed in the central nervous system and haemopoietic cells. Although Pyk2 is homologous to FAK, its role in signaling pathways was shown to be distinct from that of FAK. We show here that Pyk2 is highly expressed in peritoneal IC-21 macrophage and is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to cell attachment to fibronectin and fibrinogen. Upon IC-21 cell adhesion, 	Pyk2	 tyrosine phosphorylation is inhibited by blocking antibodies to the integrin subunits alpha(M) and beta(2). Furthermore, Pyk2 is rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated in response to ligation of beta(2) integrins by antibodies. In migrating macrophages, Pyk2 localizes to perinuclear regions and to podosomes, where it is clustered with tyrosine phosphorylated proteins. Furthermore, in the podosomal ring structure, which surrounds the central actin core, Pyk2 co-localizes with vinculin, talin, and paxillin. In the podosomes, Pyk2 also co-localizes with the integrin alpha(M)beta(2). Lastly, reduction of Pyk2 expression in macrophages leads to inhibition of cell migration. We propose that Pyk2 is functionally linked to the formation

RESULTS: Thrombin reduced ZO-1 gene expression (P < 0.05) and enhanced expression of the genes encoding alpha-SMA and the pro-alpha1 chain of collagen type-1 (P < 0.05), indicating EMT. Also, ZO-1 protein expression declined on thrombin stimulation, whereas production of alpha-SMA and collagen increased. In contrast to thrombin, factor Xa hardly stimulated EMT by RPE. Thrombin clearly induced PDGF-BB production and PDGF-Rbeta chain phosphorylation in RPE. Moreover, 	AG1296	 significantly blocked the effect of thrombin on EMT and collagen production. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that thrombin is a potent inducer of EMT by RPE via autocrine activation of PDGF-receptor signaling.

The suppressive effects of TCV-116 against the reflex tachycardia tended to be more obvious in WKY than in SHR, though the difference was not statistically significant. Concurrent administration of propranolol almost completely inhibited both the reflex tachycardia and the sinus tachycardia in SHR and WKY, indicating that 	the sympathetic nervous system	 contributes to both types of tachycardia.

Intratumoral NK cells displayed a profound and coordinated alteration of their phenotype, with a drastic reduction of NK cell receptor expression specifically detected in the tumoral region. According to their altered phenotype, intratumoral NK cells exhibited 	profound defects	 in the ability to activate degranulation and IFN-gamma production. We found that the presence of NK cells did not impact the clinical outcome of patients with NSCLC. Finally, we showed that tumor cells heterogeneously express ligands for both activating and inhibitory NK receptors.

BACKGROUND: Matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1), an interstitial collagenase, plays an important role in the breakdown of extracellular matrix and mediates pathways of apoptosis, angiogenesis, and immunity. It has been demonstrated that the overexpression of this enzyme is associated with tumor initiation, invasion, and metastasis. The -1607 single guanine (1G)-to-2G polymorphism (reference single nucleotide polymorphism 1799750) in the MMP-1 promoter region creates an E26 (Ets) binding site and results in transcriptional up-regulation. The authors hypothesized that this MMP-1 polymorphism may affect susceptibility to the development and progression of cancer. METHODS: The authors investigated their hypothesis in a 	lung cancer	 case-control study. Genotypes were analyzed in 825 patients with lung cancer and in 825 controls. Odds ratios were estimated by multivariate logistic regression, and a meta-analysis also was conducted to verify the findings.

The present study was designed to investigate the roles and molecular mechanisms of CHOP in ALF. In the liver tissues from ALF patients, the expression of CHOP was significantly increased, which was accompanied by increased expression of dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK) signalling, activating transcription factor 4 (ATF6) signalling, inositol-requiring enzyme-1 (IRE1) signalling and ERO1alpha, as compared with healthy controls. In the mouse model of galactosamine (GaIN)/lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALF, the hepatocellular injury was accompanied by up-regulated PERK signalling, 	ATF6	 signalling, IRE1 signalling, CHOP and ERO1alpha. In contrast, CHOP deficiency decreased hepatocellular apoptosis/necrosis and increased animal survival. Furthermore, disruption of CHOP decreased ERO1alpha expression leading to reducing ROS-induced cell death in vivo and in vitro. Interestingly, ERO1alpha overexpression restored GaIN/LPS-induced hepatocellular injury in CHOP-deficient mice. Our studies demonstrate for the first time that CHOP promotes liver damage during ALF through activation of ERO1alpha, a key mediator to link ER stress and ROS. Therefore, targeting CHOP/ERO1alpha signalling could be a novel therapeutic approach during ALF. DOCEND

In this regard, among several G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), GPR120 and GPR40 have recently been considered as viable targets for diabetes and metabolic disorders. AREAS COVERED: This article reviews the current literature on the discovery and development of GPR120 agonists in diabetes and metabolic disorders and updates on the published patents in this field. The patent study for this review has been carried out using multiple electronic databases including SciFinder and Thomson Reuters Integrity. EXPERT OPINION: A paradigm shift in the treatment of diabetes is needed, wherein a single therapeutic agent could target 	diabetes	 and its associated disorders such as high plasma glucose level and inflammation, with excellent safety and tolerability profile. In this regard, agonists of GPR120 or dual-agonist GPR120 and GPR40 are highly anticipated as therapeutic approaches for the treatment of diabetes on the basis of their novel glucose-dependent mechanism of action.

Hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) is known to be potentially denaturing to proteins, but the effects of mobile phase conditions on chromatographic behavior are not well understood. In this study, we apply a model describing the effects of secondary protein unfolding equilibrium on chromatographic behavior, including the effects of salt concentration on both stability and adsorption. We use alpha-lactalbumin as 	a model protein	 that in the presence and absence of calcium, allows evaluation of adsorption parameters for folded and unfolded species independently. The HIC adsorption equilibrium under linear binding conditions and solution phase protein stability have been obtained from a combination of literature and new experiments. The effect of salt concentration on protein stability and the rate constant for unfolding on the chromatographic surface have been determined by fitting the model to isocratic chromatography data under marginally stable conditions. The model successfully describes the effects of added calcium and ammonium sulfate. The results demonstrate the importance of considering the effects on stability of

The immune response towards allergens in non-allergic healthy individuals was investigated. T cell lines (TCL) with specificity for Bet v 1, the major birch pollen allergen, were established and analysed for epitope specificity. 49 T cell clones (TCC) specific for Bet v 1 were isolated from TCLs. All TCCs revealed the Th phenotype. Cytokine production in response to specific stimulation revealed a majority of Th clones producing interleukin (IL)-4 and interferon (IFN)-gamma; however, 	most TCCs	 revealed a low IL-4/IFN-gamma ratio. Immunoblot revealed Bet v 1-specific IgG in non-allergic individuals whereas no IgE could be detected. Our results indicate that T cells from allergic and non-allergic individuals recognize the same epitopes on allergenic molecules, leading to activation, which then results in a differential production of cytokines and consequently to differential isotype switching in allergen-specific B cells.

29984036	T17	ggp	DOCSTART Inhibition of Mast Cell Function and Proliferation by mTOR Activator MHY1485. Mast cells integrate innate and adaptive immunity and are implicated in pathophysiological conditions, including allergy, asthma, and anaphylaxis. Cross-linking of the high-affinity IgE receptor (FcepsilonRI) initiates diverse signal transduction pathways and induces release of proinflammatory mediators by mast cells. In this study, we demonstrated that hyperactivation of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling using the mTOR activator MHY1485 suppresses FcepsilonRI-mediated mast cell degranulation and cytokine secretion. MHY1485 treatment increased ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (	4E-BP1	) phosphorylation, which are downstream targets of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), but decreased phosphorylation of Akt on mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) target site serine 473. In addition, this activator decreased beta-hexosaminidase, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) release in murine bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) after FcepsilonRI stimulation. Furthermore, MHY1485-treated BMMCs showed significantly decreased proliferation when cultured with IL-3. These findings suggested hyperactivation of mTORC1 as a therapeutic strategy for mast cell-related diseases. DOCEND

Precise electrical contact between single-molecule and electrodes is a first step to study single-molecule electronics and its application such as (bio)sensors and nanodevices. To realize a reliable electrical contact, we can use DNA as a template in the field of nanoelectronics because of its micrometer-scaled length with the thickness of nanometer-scale. In this paper, we studied the reactivity of the amide-coupling reaction to tether oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) to organic molecules and the elongation of the ODNs by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to synthesize 1.5 kbp dsDNA-organic molecule-1.5 kbp dsDNA (DOD) triblock architecture. The successful amide-coupling reactions were confirmed by 	electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS)	, and the triblock architectures were characterized by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and atomic force microscope (AFM). Our result shows that this strategy is simple and makes it easy to construct DNA-organic molecule-DNA triblock architectures and potentially provides a platform to prepare and investigate single molecule electronics.

Time of maximum cycloplegia was determined from the time point at which the 95% confidence interval of the differences between the mean spherical equivalent at each point and its final value at 110 minutes was reached and remained within the equivalence limit (+/-0.25 D). RESULTS: Sixty children were enrolled in this study. Their mean age was 9.8 years (range: 5-4 years). Time of maximum cycloplegia was reached at 30 minutes after the first instillation of 	cyclopentolate	. A poor correlation was observed between the pupillary reaction and the time of maximum cycloplegia (r=-0.07). The mean pupillary diameter at 30 minutes was 3.7+/-1.3 mm, and further dilation occurred thereafter. No side effects were observed. CONCLUSION: In most children, maximum cycloplegia was reached 30 minutes after the first instillation of cyclopentolate. The absence of a pupillary reaction should not be used as an indicator of maximum cycloplegia. DOCEND

Self-assembly and function of biologically modified metal nanostructures depend on surface-selective adsorption; however, the influence of the shape of metal surfaces on peptide adsorption mechanisms has been poorly understood. The adsorption of single peptide molecules in aqueous solution (Tyr(12) , Ser(12) , A3, Flg-Na(3) ) is investigated on even {111} surfaces, stepped surfaces, and a 2 nm cuboctahedral nanoparticle of gold using molecular dynamics simulation with the CHARMM-METAL force field. 	Strong and selective adsorption	 is found on even surfaces and the inner edges of stepped surfaces (-20 to -60 kcal/mol peptide) in contrast to weaker and less selective adsorption on small nanoparticles (-15 to -25 kcal/mol peptide). Binding and selectivity appear to be controlled by the size of surface features and the extent of co-ordination of epitaxial sites by polarizable atoms (N, O, C) along the peptide chain. The adsorption energy of a single peptide equals a fraction of the sum of the adsorption energies of individual amino acids that is characteristic of surface shape, epitaxial pattern, and conformation constraints (often beta-strand and random

The characteristics of nightmares of 48 male U.S. Vietnam war veterans with combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as well as revised dream scripts developed in the course of Imagery Rehearsal therapy, were examined in relation to pretreatment symptomatology and treatment outcome. Features, content, and themes of nightmares and rescripted dreams were coded by 2 independent raters. 	Nightmares	 were replete with scenes of death and violence and were predominantly replays of actual combat events in which the veteran was under attack and feared for his life. Although addressing or resolving the nightmare theme with rescripting was associated with a reduction in sleep disturbance, references to violence in the rescripted dream were related to poorer treatment outcome in nightmare frequency; B = 5.69 (SE = 1.14). The experience of olfactory sensations in nightmares, a possible index of nightmare intensity, was also related to poorer treatment response; B = 2.95 (SE = 1.06).

Like other nuclear receptors, AR exerts its transcriptional function by binding to cis-elements upstream of promoters and interacting with other transcriptional factors (e.g. activators, repressors and modulators). To determine the mechanism of AR-regulated transcription, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify AR-associated proteins. One of the proteins we identified is identical to the human origin recognition complex-interacting protein termed HBO1. A ligand-enhanced interaction between AR and HBO1 was further confirmed in vivo and in vitro. Immunofluorescence experiments showed that 	HBO1	 is a nuclear protein, and Northern blot analysis revealed that it is ubiquitously expressed, with the highest levels present in human testis. HBO1 belongs to the MYST family, which is characterized by a highly conserved C2HC zinc finger and a putative histone acetyltransferase domain. Surprisingly, two yeast members of the MYST family, SAS2 and SAS3, have been shown to function as transcription silencers, despite the presence of the histone acetyltransferase domain. Using a GAL4 DNA-binding domain assay, we mapped a transcriptional repression domain within the N-terminal region of HBO1. Transient transfection experiments revealed that HBO1 specifically repressed AR-mediated transcription in

Mechanical stimuli were used to selectively activate individual nerve fibers, and the receptive field and receptor type were identified for 	each unit	. Over a period of six months, there was a net shift in the recorded population, but the electrodes continued to provide a representative sample of the activity in the fascicle as a whole. The total number of units from which activity could be recorded remained roughly constant with time, and individual units persisted in the recordings for up to six months.

These observations are consistent with the following conclusions: 1) isoproterenol and cyclic AMP potentiate the electrogenic pumping of sodium and potassium responsible for potassium-induced relaxation; 2) the relaxing action of isoproterenol, dibutyryl-cyclic AMP and 	theophylline	 are dependent upon experimental conditions and the species from which the vascular tissue is obtained; and 3) there is a component of isoproterenol- and cyclic AMP-induced relaxation which is not altered by inhibition of the electrogenic sodium pump in the rat.

The model also exhibits domino-like behaviour, where the limit cycle oscillations take place in a stepwise fashion. As the aforementioned topology is abstracted from the budding yeast cell cycle, the events that govern the cell cycle are considered for the present study. In budding yeast, the sequential activation of the transcription factors, cyclins and their inhibitors form mixed feedback loops. The transcription factors that involve in the positive regulation in a clockwise orientation generates 	ternary positive feedback loop	, while the cyclins and their inhibitors that involve in the negative regulation in an anticlockwise orientation generates ternary negative feedback loop. The mutual regulation between the corresponding elements in the transcription factors and the cyclins and their inhibitors generates binary positive feedback loops. The bifurcation diagram constructed for the whole system can be related to the different events of the cell cycle in terms of dynamical system theory. The checkpoint mechanism that plays an important role in different phases of the cell cycle are accounted for by silencing appropriate feedback loops in the model. DOCEND

After a 7-day latency period, distraction was activated at 0.5mm/12h and consolidation lasted for 6 or 12 weeks. Three dogs were killed after 6 and 12 weeks' consolidation for gross, radiographic, and histological observations to be made. Curvilinear distraction osteogenesis was successful in 5/6 animals. At 	both time points	 smooth curved bone had been restored in the distracted areas, and radiographic and histological examination showed that the generated bone was similar to normal bone after 12 weeks' consolidation.

Tumstatin is an angiogenesis inhibitor that binds to alphavbeta3 integrin and suppresses tumor growth. Previous deletion mutagenesis studies identified a 25-aa fragment of tumstatin (tumstatin peptide) with in vitro antiangiogenic activity. Here, we demonstrate that systemic administration of this tumstatin peptide inhibits tumor growth and angiogenesis. Site-directed mutagenesis identified amino acids L, 	V	, and D as essential for the antiangiogenic activity of tumstatin. The tumstatin peptide binds to alphavbeta3 integrin on proliferating endothelial cells and localizes to select tumor endothelium in vivo. Using 3D molecular modeling, we identify a putative interaction interface for tumstatin peptide on alphavbeta3 integrin. The antitumor activity of the tumstatin peptide, in combination with bevacizumab (anti-VEGF antibody), displays significant improvement in efficacy against human renal cell carcinoma xenografts when compared with the single-agent use.

Thyroid hormone (TH) is essential for proper development in vertebrates. TH deficiency during gestation and early postnatal development produces severe neurological, skeletal, metabolism and growth abnormalities. It is therefore important to consider environmental chemicals that may interfere with TH signaling. Exposure to environmental contaminants that disrupt TH action may underlie the increasing incidence of human developmental disorders worldwide. One contaminant of concern is the xenoestrogen bisphenol A (BPA), 	a chemical	 widely used to manufacture polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins. The difficulty in studying uterus-enclosed mammalian embryos has hampered the analysis on the direct effects of BPA during vertebrate development. As TH action at the cellular level is highly conserved across vertebrate species, amphibian metamorphosis serves as an important TH-dependent in vivo vertebrate model for studying potential contributions of BPA toward human developmental disorders. Using Xenopus laevis as a model, we and others have demonstrated the inhibitory effects of BPA exposure on metamorphosis.

Natural killer (NK) cells spontaneously detect and kill cancerous and virally infected cells through receptors that transduce either activating or inhibiting signals. The majority of well studied NK receptors are involved in inhibitory signaling. However, we have previously described an activating receptor, 2B4, expressed on all murine NK cells and a subset of T cells that mediate non-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) restricted killing. Anti-2B4 monoclonal antibodies directed against IL-2-activated NK cells enhanced their destruction of tumor cells.

Here, we investigated the role of LXRalpha in capsaicin mediated anti-inflammatory effects. Results revealed that 	capsaicin	 inhibits LPS-induced IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha production in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Moreover, capsaicin increases LXRalpha expression through PPARgamma pathway. Inhibition of LXRalpha activation by siRNA diminished the inhibitory action of capsaicin on LPS-induced IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha production. Additionally, LXRalpha siRNA abrogated the inhibitory action of capsaicin on p65 NF-kappaB protein expression. Thus, we propose that the anti-inflammatory effects of capsaicin are LXRalpha dependent, and LXRalpha may potentially link the capsaicin mediated PPARgamma activation and NF-kappaB inhibition in LPS-induced inflammatory response.

The lanthipeptide synthetases of classes III and IV share a similar organization of protein domains: A lyase domain at the N-terminus, a central kinase domain, and a C-terminal cyclase domain.

Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) are cytoplasmic proteins that bind to activated membrane receptors, undergo ligand-dependent phosphorylation on tyrosine residues, and translocate to the nucleus, where they induce transcription of specific genes in response to a variety of ligands, including cytokines and some growth factors. Using immunocytochemical and biochemical techniques, we investigated the localization and responses of STAT1 and STAT2 to epidermal growth factor (	EGF	) stimulation in IEC-6 intestinal epithelial cells and HeLa cells. These studies provide the first description of STAT activation and localization in response to EGF in intestinal epithelial cells and some novel findings regarding the activation and localization of STATs in general. These include the following. First, EGF promoted the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 in IEC-6 cells and caused its translocation to the nucleus. Second, in the absence of EGF stimulation both STAT1 and STAT2 were localized to the Golgi apparatus in IEC-6 cells. Third, EGF caused the translocation of STAT2 to the nucleus in both IEC-6 and HeLa cells without

We investigated the spatial relationship of axonal and dendritic structures in the rat pontine nuclei (PN), which transfer visual signals from the superior colliculus (SC) and visual cortex (A17) to the cerebellum. 	Double anterograde tracing	 (DiI and DiAsp) from different sites in the SC showed that the tectal retinotopy of visual signals is largely lost in the PN. Whereas axon terminals from lateral sites in the SC were confined to a single terminal field close to the cerebral peduncle, medial sites in the SC projected to an additional dorsolateral one. On the other hand, axon terminals originating from the two structures occupy close but, nevertheless, totally nonoverlapping terminal fields within the PN. Furthermore, a quantitative analysis of the dendritic trees of intracellularly filled identified pontine projection neurons showed that the dendritic fields were confined to

The authors evaluated the use of technetium-99m albumin colloid white blood cell (TAC-WBC) scan in women with possible appendicitis. One hundred and nine women underwent 110 TAC-WBC scans. One woman had a second scan on a separate admission and was considered two individual patients in the analysis. Twenty-six women had appendicitis, 10 of whom had a perforated appendix at surgery. The TAC-WBC scan was indeterminate (abnormal but nondiagnostic for appendicitis) in 52 women (47%), nine of whom had 	appendicitis	. Fifty-eight scans were read as positive or negative for appendiceal pathology. There were 16 true positives, 5 false positives, 36 true negatives, and 1 false negative. The predictive value of a positive scan was 76%, and the predictive value of a negative scan was 97%. The TAC-WBC scan was positive in 62% of patients with appendicitis and negative in 43% of the patients without appendicitis resulting in an overall accuracy of 47% in the 109 women. The main value of TAC-WBC scan in women with possible appendicitis is its high negative predictive value and the main problem with the TAC-WBC

Charge detection mass spectrometry (CDMS) measurements have been performed for cytochrome c and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) monomer using a modified cone trap incorporating a cryogenically cooled JFET. Cooling the JFET increases its transconductance and lowers thermal noise, improving 	the signal to noise (S/N) ratio	. Single ions with as few as 9 elementary charges (e) have been detected. According to simulations, the detection efficiency for ions with a charge of 13 e is 75%, and for charges above 13 e the detection efficiency rapidly approaches 95%. With the low limit of detection achieved here, adjacent charge states are easily resolved in the m/z spectrum, so the accuracy and precision of the image charge measurements can be directly evaluated by comparing the measured image charge to the charge deduced from the m/z spectrum.

In particular, the effect of adrenergic stimulation on extracellular matrix (ECM) protein production by human cardiovascular cells is unknown. The present study thus investigated the direct effect of adrenergic stimulation on ECM protein production by cultured human vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cells. METHODS AND RESULTS: Exposing human VSM cells to norepinephrine increased collagen protein production by 42%, P < 0.01, when compared to control (unstimulated) cells. This effect was mediated by the alpha1-adrenoceptor, since it was inhibited by the selective alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist; 	prazosin	 (2 micromol/l) and reproduced by the selective alpha1-adrenoceptor agonist; phenylephrine (10 micromol/l). In contrast, beta-adrenoceptor stimulation - isoprenaline (1 micromol/l) or norepinephrine (10 micromol/l) + prazosin (2 micromol/l) - inhibited collagen production by 12%, P < 0.01. This inhibitory effect was mediated via the beta1-adrenoceptor, since it was blocked by atenolol (beta1-adrenoceptor antagonist) but not butoxamine (beta2-adrenoceptor antagonist). Fibronectin, another ECM protein, was similarly regulated by alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor stimulation. Transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta1) mRNA expression by human VSM cells was also significantly influenced by adrenergic stimulation, being increased by phenylephrine (alpha-agonist) and inhibited by isoprenaline (beta-agonist). CONCLUSIONS: These results uniquely demonstrate the

Infusion of supraphysiological concentrations of ascorbic acid increased femoral artery blood flow by 37% in the older men (to 327 +/- 52 ml/min; P < 0.05), but not in the young men (352 +/- 41 ml/min; P = 0.28), thus abolishing group differences (P = 0.72). Mean arterial blood pressure was greater in the older men at baseline (86 +/- 4 vs. 78 +/- 2 mmHg; P < 0.05), but it was unaffected by ascorbic acid infusion (P >/= 0.70). As 	a result	, the lower baseline femoral artery blood flow in the older men was mediated solely by a 32% lower femoral artery vascular conductance (P < 0.05). Baseline femoral vascular conductance also was inversely related to plasma oxidized LDL (r = -0.65, P < 0.01). Ascorbic acid increased femoral vascular conductance by 36% in the older men (P < 0.05) but not in the young men (P = 0.31). In conclusion, ascorbic acid infused at concentrations known to scavenge reactive oxygen species restores resting femoral artery blood flow in healthy older adult men by increasing vascular conductance.

The aim of this study was to investigate donor site morbidity with a unique emphasis on objective measurements of perfusion and oxygenation. METHODS: In a prospective study 15 male patients with recurrent urethral strictures, underwent urethroplasty using an intraoral mucosal graft. Donor site was closed primarily (group 1) or left to granulation (group 2). Clinical examinations of recipient and donor sites, urograms and the modified SF-8(TM) health questionnaire were carried out 1, 3 and 24 weeks postoperatively. Oxygenation and perfusion parameters of the donor site were measured by the O2C (	oxygen	-to-see) monitoring device - a combined technique of laser Doppler flowmetry and tissue spectroscopy. RESULTS: No recurrence of strictures at recipient site or infections at either sites occurred. 24 weeks after operation, haemoglobin oxygenation (72.1+/-5.9%) and deep flow (177.2 Arbitrary Units (AU)) of the donor site were slightly, but not significantly, lower compared to the contralateral unoperated buccal mucosa (haemoglobin oxygenation: 75.4+/-5.2%, deep flow: 187.3 AU). Significant differences between the two groups of different wound healing could not be revealed.

Here, we explore the binding partners of RUNX3 proteins to further define the scope of RUNX3 function.

RESULTS: Total positive expression rates of CXCR4 and VEGF were 95% (38/40) and 85% (34/40) respectively. The expression rates of CXCR4 and VEGF were found positive obviously in hemangioblastomas compared with the normal cerebellar tissues (P < 0.01). CXCR4 expression was located in the nucleus of tumor stromal cells. VEGF expression was located in the cytoplasm and membrane of tumor stromal cells and some endothelial cells.

RESULTS: During the study period, 122 AECOPD patients (51% male, mean age (SE) 71 (+/-11) years) presented to the ED. Ninety-eight (80%) patients were hospitalized. Univariate analysis identified certain factors associated with hospitalization: Older age, former smokers, home oxygen therapy, weekday presentation, SpO2 < 92%, and raised inflammatory markers (white cell count (WCC) and C-reactive protein (	CRP	)). After adjustment for multiple variable, increased age was significantly associated with hospitalization (odds ratio (OR) 1.09; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.00-1.18; P = 0.05). Radiology assessment and pharmacological management was in accordance with COPD guidelines. However, spirometry was performed in 17% of patients and 28% of patients with hypercapneic respiratory failure received noninvasive ventilation (NIV).

Quasi-static hysteresis became more important (36 +/- 11% of the corresponding dynamic PA-volume loop) during inspiratory capacity ventilation and after induced bronchoconstriction (27 +/- 12% of the corresponding dynamic PA-volume loop). We conclude that during tidal breathing near functional residual capacity "true" static hysteresis is negligible and that purely viscoelastic processes can explain lung mechanical behavior. For higher volume ventilation and after 	methacholine	-induced constriction, quasi-static hysteresis accounted for a more important portion of dynamic tissue hysteresis. This suggests either that a more complex model, e.g., one including plastic processes, should be invoked or that the lung exhibits longer viscoelastic time constants as peak distending stresses become greater.

Kahalalide F (KF) is a small natural peptide that showed activity in vitro and in vivo. The dose-limiting toxicity in clinical trials was transaminitis. We investigated the cytotoxicity of KF in cell lines from breast, ovary, 	prostate	 and colon cancers, but focused on hepatoma cell lines, performing mechanistic studies in HepG2 (IC50 = 0.3 microM) and PLC/PRF/5C (IC50 = 5 microM). Following KF exposure, HepG2 cells demonstrated profound ATP depletion, associated with cell swelling and cell blebbing, and increased permeability to propidium iodide (PI), annexin V (AV) and release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). PLC/PRF/5C cells retained their cell structure, but were permeable to PI and, following exposure to high concentrations of KF, to AV. The pattern of cell permeability is similar to maitotoxin, another small cytotoxic peptide, but the differential effects on the cell membrane induced by KF in

PURPOSE: Radiation-induced optic nerve damage was reduced by ramipril, a prodrug angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI). This study was to determine the optimum dose and administration time of ramipril for mitigating radiation-induced optic neuropathy. MATERIALS AND METHOD: Adult Fischer 344 male rats were treated with a single dose radiation 30 Gy by using radiosurgical technique. After irradiation, the animals were randomly assigned into 	groups	 of different ramipril doses and administration time; control (no treatment), radiation alone, radiation+ramipril in different doses and starting times of drug. Ramipril was given 0.5-1.5 mg/kg/day and AT1R blocker Losartan 20 mg/kg/day in drinking water for 180 days. Functional endpoint with visual evoked potential (VEP) and anatomical endpoint with gross and histological analysis with immunohistochemical (IHC) stain were used. RESULTS: Normal VEP measurements in un-irradiated rats were 46.2+/-7.9 ms. There was no change of VEP value until 4 months, but was lengthened to 188.1+/-58.7 ms at 6 months after radiation.

A pectin methylesterase inhibitor (SolyPMEI) from 	tomato	 has been identified and characterised by a functional genomics approach. SolyPMEI is a cell wall protein sharing high similarity with Actinidia deliciosa PMEI (AdPMEI), the best characterised inhibitor from kiwi. It typically affects the activity of plant pectin methylesterases (PMEs) and is inactive against a microbial PME. SolyPMEI transcripts were mainly expressed in flower, pollen and ripe fruit where the protein accumulated at breaker and turning stages of ripening.

The low-flow, reflow liver perfusion model was used to study the role of Kupffer cells (KC) in reperfusion injury to fatty livers from rats fed a diet containing ethanol for 4-5 weeks. Treatment with GdCl3, which selectively destroys KC, decreased cell death significantly. Thus, destruction of KC minimized hepatic reperfusion injury, most likely by inhibiting free radical formation and improving microcirculation. Since it was demonstrated recently that destruction of KC prevented the hypermetabolic state observed with acute alcohol exposure, their involvement in 	events	 leading to alcohol-induced liver disease was investigated. In rats exposed to ethanol continuously via intragastric feeding for up to 4 weeks, GdCl3 treatment prevented elevation of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and dramatically reduced the average hepatic pathological score. These results indicate that KC participate in the early phases of alcohol-induced liver injury. Endotoxaemia occurs in alcoholics and activates KC; therefore, we evaluated the effect of minimizing bacterial endotoxin by intestinal sterilization with the antibiotics polymyxin B and neomycin. Antibiotics diminished plasma endotoxin levels significantly and prevented ethanol-induced increases in AST values. These results indicate that endotoxin is involved in the mechanism

This was accomplished by evaluation of the dynamics of the dfCNP-elicited secretion of catecholamines in situ and in vivo. With an in situ saline-perfused postcardinal sinus preparation, it was demonstrated that perfusion with saline containing dfCNP (10(-9) mol x L(-1)) did not affect the secretion of either noradrenaline or adrenaline. However, the presence of dfCNP in the perfusate significantly enhanced carbachol-evoked secretion of noradrenaline.

The postoperative graft function rate was significantly better in the surgical group (p < 0.05). Thirty-six percent of grafts managed surgically remained functional at 6 months and 25% at 12 months. In the endovascular group, 11% were functional at 6 months and 9% by 12 months. Patients with long-segment venous outflow stenosis or occlusion had a significantly worse patency rate than those with venous anastomotic stenosis (p < 0.05).

Post fertilization growth of tobacco ovary tissues treated with inhibitors of polyamine (PA) biosynthesis was examined in relation to endogenous PA titers and the activities of arginine decarboxylase (ADC, EC 4.1.1.19) and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC, EC 4.1.1.17). DL-alpha-Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) and DL-alpha-difluoromethylarginine (DFMA), specific, irreversible ("suicide") inhibitors of ODC and ADC in vitro, were used to modulate PA biosynthesis in excised flowers. 	ODC	 represented >99% of the total decarboxylase activity in tobacco ovaries. In vivo inhibition of ODC with DFMO resulted in a significant decrease in PA titers, ovary fresh weight and protein content. Simultaneous inhibition of both decarboxylases by DFMO and DFMA produced only a marginally greater depression in growth and PA titers, indicating that ODC activity is rate-limiting for PA biosynthesis in these tissues. Paradoxically, DFMA alone inhibited PA biosynthesis, not as a result of a specific inhibition of ADC, but primarily through the inactivation of ODC. In vivo inhibition of ODC by DFMA appears to result from arginase-mediated hydrolysis of

The positive rate in malignant tumor was 83.33%; the strong positive rate was 41.03%. However, the positive expression rate in benign tumor was 27.27%. The level of stromal HA expression increased along with histologic gradation. The expression level in serous adenocarcinoma was higher than that in other pathologic types. Expression of HA in stroma and expression of 	CD44	 in the tumor cells were significantly correlated; and the correlation of HA expression with histologic gradations was better than that of CD44.

These mutants can be divided into three classes: class 1, low enzyme level and low rate of tryptophan excretion; class 2, high enzyme level and intermediate rate of tryptophan excretion; and class 3, high enzyme level and high rate of tryptophan excretion. A bradytrophic requirement for 	phenylalanine	 is correlated with the rate of tryptophan excretion. The phenylalanine requirement is relieved when the rate of tryptophan excretion is reduced by either (i) lowering the level of the tryptophan enzymes, (ii) reducing the supply of a tryptophan precursor (chorismate), or (iii) stopping tryptophan synthesis by a mutational block in the pathway. All of the mutants map in a region of the chromosome previously reported as the mtr locus.

Mice bearing an MCF-7(DOX) tumor on one flank and an MCF-7(WT) tumor on the other flank were used to assess the in vivo efficacy. Furthermore, the responses to STX140 of three xenografts, derived from drug-resistant patients, were assessed. RESULTS: In this study, STX140 caused cell cycle arrest, cyclin B1 induction, and subsequent apoptosis of both MCF-7(DOX) and MCF-7(WT) cells. Taxol and 2-MeOE2 were only active in the MCF-7(WT) parental cell line. Although both STX140 and Taxol inhibited the growth of xenografts derived from MCF-7(WT) cells, only 	STX140	 inhibited the growth of tumors derived from MCF-7(DOX) cells. 2-MeOE2 was ineffective at the dose tested against both tumor types. Two out of the three newly derived docetaxel-resistant xenografts, including a metastatic triple-negative tumor, responded to STX140 but not to docetaxel treatment. CONCLUSIONS: STX140 shows excellent efficacy in both MCF-7(WT) and MCF-7(DOX) breast cancer xenograft models, in contrast to Taxol and 2-MeOE2. The clinical potential of STX140 was further highlighted by the efficacy seen in xenografts recently derived from patients who had failed on taxane therapy. DOCEND

According to ClinicalTrials.gov at present there are no running pilot studies, which could assess possible therapeutic benefits from curcumin supplementation to patients with primary epithelial ovarian cancer. Therefore, the goal of this review was to evaluate potential preclinical properties of curcumin and its new analogues on the basis of in vivo and in vitro ovarian cancer studies.

It was suggested that folding is prevented either by co-translational secretion or by the assistance of specific Yop chaperones (called Sycs). RESULTS: In this study we have fused YopE secretion signals of various length to the mouse dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) in order to analyse the DHFR folding state prior to secretion. We could demonstrate that secretion-deficient as well as secretion-competent YopE-DHFR fusions complexed to SycE can be efficiently purified from Yersinia cytosol by affinity chromatography using 	methotrexate	-agarose. This implies the folding of the DHFR fusion moiety despite SycE binding and contradicts the previously presented model of folding inhibition by chaperone binding. Secretion-deficient YopE-DHFR fusions caused severe jamming of the TTSS. This observation contradicts the co-translational secretion model. CONCLUSIONS: We present evidence that the Yersinia TTSS is familiar with the processing of transport substrates which are folded prior to secretion. We therefore predict that an unfoldase is involved in type III secretion. DOCEND

Full chimeras that received fully MHC-disparate HSCs showed delayed T-dependent Ab responses that recovered by 12 wk. This delay occurred despite early reconstitution and proper migration to germinal centers of donor-derived T(follicular helper) (T(FH)) cells. Congenic transplants into T(FH)-deficient CD4(-/-) mice revealed restoration of T-dependent Ab responses by 6 wk, leading us to conclude that MHC disparity caused delay in humoral recovery. These findings, together with our previous studies, show that, contrary to the view that 	depletion	 of graft lymphocytes results in poor posttransplant immunity, elimination of immune-suppressing graft-versus-host reactions permits superior immune reconstitution. This study also provides insight into the regeneration of T(FH) cells and humoral immunity after allogeneic HSC transplantation. DOCEND

Neutrophilic polymorphonuclear leukocytes can mediate glomerulonephritis by releasing reactive oxygen species such as H2O2. We have previously demonstrated that H2O2-mediated glomerular injury can be potentiated by reaction with polymorphonuclear leukocyte myeloperoxidase (MPO). When 	MPO	 was perfused into renal arteries of rats, it bound to the glomerular capillary wall due to its cationic charge. Subsequent perfusion with nontoxic concentrations of H2O2 and halides resulted in acute glomerular injury, halogenation of the glomerular basement membrane, and proteinuria. The studies reported here document the morphologic changes that accompany MPO-mediated glomerular injury. Acutely, there is severe injury to the endothelium with cell swelling and lysis. Within 10 minutes, a marked platelet influx occurs. Platelets frequently occlude capillary lumens and bind to areas of denuded glomerular basement membrane where platelet degranulation results.

The concentrations of eosinophil cationic protein and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin in supernatants of eosinophils were significantly greater in the presence of recombinant soluble ICAM-1 than in its absence (p < 0.05). These results suggest that signals from ICAM-1 and its ligands induce eosinophil activation and are involved in degranulation of eosinophil granule proteins. In addition, reactive oxygen species generated by eosinophils have also been considered capable of causing airway injury at sites of inflammation. The effect of recombinant soluble ICAM-1 and its ligands on eosinophil-induced radical oxygen products was studied. Recombinant soluble ICAM-1 augmented eosinophil oxidative metabolism. Therefore, signaling via 	adhesion molecules	 might play an important role in the pathogenesis of allergic inflammation. Specifically, it may activate eosinophils and increase oxidative metabolism or cause degranulation of eosinophil granule proteins. DOCEND

The results of the viability assays showed that AEME is a neurotoxic agent that has greater neurotoxic potential than cocaine after 24 and 48 h of exposure. We also showed that incubation for 48 h with a combination of both compounds in equipotent concentrations had an additive neurotoxic effect. Although both substances decreased cell viability in the MTT assay, only cocaine increased LDH release. Caspase-3 activity was increased after 3 and 6 h of incubation with 1mM cocaine and after 6 h of 0.1 and 1.0mM AEME exposure. Atropine prevented the AEME-induced 	neurotoxicity	, which suggests that muscarinic cholinergic receptors are involved in AEME's effects. In addition, binding experiments confirmed that AEME has an affinity for muscarinic cholinergic receptors. Nevertheless, atropine was not able to prevent the neurotoxicity produced by cocaine and the cocaine-AEME combination, suggesting that these treatments activated other neuronal death pathways. Our results suggest a higher risk for neurotoxicity after smoking crack cocaine than after cocaine use alone. DOCEND

Cultured normal human keratinocytes obtained from 14 facial skin biopsies of donors aged 9-79 y were used to study the influence of donor age on the integrin receptors, cell adhesive properties in vitro, and type VII collagen synthesis. Immuno-spectrofluorimetric quantitation of integrins showed a decrease in the beta1- and beta4-subunits in low (0.08 mM) and high (1.8 mM) calcium conditions with aging. Calcium ions decreased the fluorescence intensity by relocating integrins at 	cell boundaries	. Measurements of adhering cells showed that adhesion to bovine serum albumin-, type IV collagen- or laminin 1-coated plastic surfaces initially increased until donor age reached 30 y and then decreased. Specific adhesion to type IV collagen and laminin 1 did not vary with age, but the increase in adhesion to type IV collagen produced by manganese ions increased with age, suggesting an age-dependent feature of beta1 integrin. Synthesis of type VII collagen, increased or not by TGFbeta1 (10 ng per ml), did not vary with the donor age.

These strains were typed by serotyping, pyocin typing, and pulsed-field electrophoresis (CHEF) of chromosomal DNA (chrDNA), and the different typing methods were analyzed. These three methods demonstrated seven identical strains. We also performed an extensive antibiogram (33 drugs) in all 14 isolates. The incidence of resistance to aminoglycosides, extended-spectrum beta-lactams, and quinolones was very high among 	the seven identical isolates	; however, the antibiogram profile differed significantly among the isolates. Our results suggest that a unique strain caused several cross-transmitted infections during this period of time, and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance has been occurring before and after the establishment of the epidemic strain by selective drug use.

1995770	T16	ggp	DOCSTART Potential role of insulin in the clearance of remnant lipoproteins in dysbetalipoproteinaemia. Dysbetalipoproteinaemia is a genetic disorder characterized by accumulation of lipoprotein remnant particles in the plasma, accelerated atherosclerosis, and the abnormal apoprotein E2. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus can aggravate the hyperlipidaemia associated with this disorder, presumably by increasing triglyceride synthesis and reducing very low density lipoprotein catabolism by lipoprotein lipase. This report documents the gradual amelioration of dysbetalipoproteinaemia in uncontrolled diabetes mellitus following therapy with exogenous insulin alone. Although the beneficial effects of 	insulin	 therapy in this patient may include inhibition of triglyceride synthesis and improved triglyceride catabolism, we propose that insulin may also stimulate clearance of atherogenic remnant lipoprotein particles.

Clinical examinations were carried out and nasopharyngeal samples taken three times. Parents recorded the symptoms of upper respiratory infection (URI) in a diary. RESULTS: Probiotic treatment did not reduce the occurrence (probiotic vs. placebo: 72% vs. 65%, OR=1.48, 95% CI 0.87-2.52, p=n.s.) or the recurrence ( three) of AOM episodes (18% vs. 17%, OR=1.04, 95% CI 0.55-1.96, p=n.s.).

17975676	T16	org	DOCSTART Knockout of cytochrome P450 3A yields new mouse models for understanding xenobiotic metabolism. Cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) enzymes constitute an important detoxification system that contributes to primary metabolism of more than half of all prescribed medications. To investigate the physiological and pharmacological roles of CYP3A, we generated Cyp3a-knockout (Cyp3a-/-) mice lacking all functional Cyp3a genes. Cyp3a-/- mice were viable, fertile, and without marked physiological abnormalities. However, these mice exhibited severely impaired detoxification capacity when exposed to the chemotherapeutic agent docetaxel, displaying higher exposure levels in response to both oral and intravenous administration. These 	mice	 also demonstrated increased sensitivity to docetaxel toxicity, suggesting a primary role for Cyp3a in xenobiotic detoxification. To determine the relative importance of intestinal versus hepatic Cyp3a in first-pass metabolism, we generated transgenic Cyp3a-/- mice expressing human CYP3A4 in either the intestine or the liver. Expression of CYP3A4 in the intestine dramatically decreased absorption of docetaxel into the bloodstream, while hepatic expression aided systemic docetaxel clearance. These results suggest that CYP3A expression determines impairment of drug absorption and efficient systemic clearance in a tissue-specific manner.

In vivo, MBD4 functions to reduce the mutability of methyl-CpG sites in the genome and mice deticient in MBD4 show increased intestinal tumorigenesis on an Apc(Min/+) background. As MLH1 and other MMR proteins have been functionally linked to apoptosis, we asked whether MBD4 also plays a role in mediating the apoptotic response within the murine small intestine. Mice deficient for MBD4 showed significantly reduced apoptotic responses 6 h following treatment with a range of cytotoxic agents including gamma-irradiation, cisplatin, 	temozolomide	 and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). This leads to increased clonogenic survival in vivo in Mbd4(-/-) mice following exposure to either 5-FU or cisplatin. We next analysed the apoptotic response to 5-FU and temozolomide in doubly mutant Mbd4(-/-), Mlh1(-/-) mice but observed no additive decrease. The results imply that MBD4 and MLH1 lie in the same pathway and therefore that MMR-dependent apoptosis is mediated through MBD4. MBD4 deficiency also reduced the normal apoptotic response to gamma-irradiation, which we show is independent of Mlh1 status (at least in the murine small intestine), so suggesting that the reliance upon MBD4 may extend beyond MMR-mediated apoptosis.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are at the centre of many physiological and pathological processes. NOX1, a ROS-producing NADPH oxidase, is highly expressed in the colon but its function in colonic physiology or pathology is still poorly understood. It has been suggested to play a role in host defence, but also in cell growth and possibly malignant transformation. In this study we characterized NOX1 expression in human colon samples derived from healthy control subjects and patients with colon cancer or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

After a successful laparoscopic left adrenalectomy, the pathological diagnosis was adrenocortical adenoma. Slow tapering of glucocorticoids was needed to prevent adrenal insufficiency after surgery, and the plasma ACTH level remained high even though the serum cortisol level had reached the upper limit of the normal range. Further examination showed a urinary THF + allo-THF/THE ratio of 0.63, which was lower than that of control (0.90 +/- 0.13, mean +/- SD). Serum cortisol/cortisone ratios after the cortisone acetate administration were also decreased, and the serum half-life of 	cortisol	 was shorter than the normal range which has been reported. These findings indicated a partial defect in 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (11beta-HSD1) activity, which converts cortisone to cortisol. Our case suggests that a change in 11beta-HSD1 activity results in inter-individual differences in glucocorticoid efficacy. DOCEND

OA droplets were distributed freely in the cytoplasm and/or degraded within lysosomes. OA exposure increased ATP production and concomitantly dilated mitochondria. At 24h after OA exposure, cell viability decreased slightly and was coupled with a reduction in mitochondrial Ca(2+) concentration, the alteration in cell viability was also associated with the generation of reactive oxygen species and changes in the cell cycle. Moreover, OA treatment increased the expression of autophagy- and apoptotic cell death-related proteins in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, we investigated the role of 	p53	, a tumor suppressor protein, in the cellular response elicited by OA accumulation. OA-induced changes in cell viability and ATP production were rescued to control levels when cells were pretreated with pifithrin-alpha (PTA), a p53 inhibitor. By contrast, the expressions of LC3-II and perilipin, proteins required for lipophagy, were down-regulated by PTA pretreatment. Taken together, our results suggest that p53 plays a key role in the cellular response elicited by OA accumulation in Chang liver cells. DOCEND

RECENT FINDINGS: It is fundamental to identify patients at risk for AKI as soon as possible and as accurately as possible. In order to achieve these goals, translational approaches implementing new biomarkers have shown promising results. Focusing on the role of potential preventive strategies, hemodynamic stabilization is the most important intervention with proven efficacy. Recent published data undermined any hope that high-dose statin therapy in statin-naive patients could exert renoprotective effects. However, preliminary data revealed the renoprotective activity of 	dexmedetomidine	 when used as a sedative agent. Moreover, several studies demonstrated the protective effects of remote ischemic preconditioning in various organs including the kidneys. The use of balanced crystalloid instead of hyperchloremic solutions also contributes to the reduction of AKI in critically ill patients. SUMMARY: To prevent AKI, it is crucial to identify patients at risk as early as possible. Establishing hemodynamic stability and an adequate intravascular volume state to ensure a sufficient perfusion pressure is the only effective therapeutic intervention. It is self-evident that nephrotoxic agents should be avoided whenever it is possible. DOCEND

RESULTS: After rabbit iliac arteries were injured by balloon overstretch angioplasty, neointima were shown to be less proliferative in the irradiated group than in the control group, from PCNA scores. The formation of neointima was suppressed with the external elastic laminar area increasing and without the luminal area decreasing in the irradiation group.

Gluconeogenesis is strongly stimulated during fasting and is aberrantly activated in diabetes mellitus. Here we show that the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1 is strongly induced in liver in fasting mice and in three mouse models of insulin action deficiency: streptozotocin-induced diabetes, ob/ob genotype and liver insulin-receptor knockout. PGC-1 is induced synergistically in primary liver cultures by cyclic AMP and glucocorticoids. Adenoviral-mediated expression of PGC-1 in hepatocytes in culture or in vivo strongly activates an entire programme of key gluconeogenic enzymes, including phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase, leading to increased 	glucose	 output. Full transcriptional activation of the PEPCK promoter requires coactivation of the glucocorticoid receptor and the liver-enriched transcription factor HNF-4alpha (hepatic nuclear factor-4alpha) by PGC-1.

Pro-oxidant properties of ascorbate have been studied with uses of brain tissues and neuronal cells. Here we address potential mechanism of ascorbate coupling with glutamate to generate oxidative stress, and the role which oxidized ascorbate (dehydroascorbate) transport plays in oxidative neuronal injury. Ascorbate in neurones can be depleted by adding glutamate in culture medium since endogenous ascorbate can be exchanged with glutamate, which enhances 	ascorbate	/dehydroascorbate transport by depleting ascorbate in the neurons with the glutamate- heteroexchange. However, ascorbate is known readily being oxidized to dehydroascorbate in the medium. Glutamate enhanced the dehydroascorbate uptake by cells via a glucose transporter (GLUT) from extracellular region, and cytosolic dehydroascorbate enhanced lipid peroxide production and reduced glutathione (GSH) concentrations. Iso-ascorbate, the epimer of ascorbate was ineffective in generating the oxidative stress. These observations support the current concept that the high rates of dehydroascorbate transport via a GLUT after the release of ascorbate by glutamate leads to peroxidation, the role of glutamate on ascorbate/dehydroascorbate recycling being critical to induce

The activity of calcineurin in the heart was also significantly increased in CaM-TG mice compared with wild-type littermates. Treatment of CaM-TG mice with the calcineurin inhibitor FK506 (1mg/kg per 	day	) prevented the increase in the heart-to-body weight ratio as well as that in cardiomyocyte width. FK506 also inhibited the induction of fetal-type cardiac gene expression in CaM-TG mice.

We aimed to evaluate the expression of hormone and insulin-related proteins within or related to the PI3K and MAPK pathway in breast tumors of women with or without diabetes mellitus, treated with or without insulin (analogues). METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was performed on tumor tissue of 312 women with invasive breast cancer, with or without pre-existing diabetes mellitus, diagnosed in 2000-2010, who were randomly selected from a Danish breast cancer cohort. Women with diabetes were 2:1 frequency matched by year of birth and age at 	breast cancer	 diagnosis to those without diabetes. Tumor Microarrays were successfully stained for p-ER, EGFR, p-ERK1/2, p-mTOR, and IGF1R, and scored by a breast pathologist. Associations of expression of these proteins with diabetes, insulin treatment (human insulin and insulin analogues) and other diabetes medication were evaluated by multivariable logistic regression adjusting for menopause and BMI; effect modification by menopausal status, BMI, and ER status was assessed using interactions terms.

We also estimated crude and adjusted relative risks (using Poisson multivariate regression modeling) to assess and control potential confounding by age, gender, race, and pain score before initial medication. Two hundred subjects were included, with 51 (25.5%) receiving intravenous or intramuscular hydromorphone, 95 (47.5%) receiving intravenous metoclopramide, and 54 (27.0%) receiving 1 of several other medications. Using a standardized pain scale of 0 to 10, mean pain score reductions were 2.3 points for hydromorphone, 3.7 points for metoclopramide, and 2.8 points for all other medications combined (P < .001). When comparing 	metoclopramide	 versus hydromorphone, the crude relative risk for pain reduction of 3 or more points was 1.76 (95% CI, 1.12-2.75, P = .01), and the adjusted relative risk was 1.60 (95% CI, 0.84-3.03, P = .15). Metoclopramide also resulted in less use of rescue medications, faster times to discharge, and no difference in the frequency of adverse reactions. PERSPECTIVE: Metoclopramide appears to be an effective initial medical treatment for migraine headaches in the emergency department setting, but its pharmacologic mechanism remains incompletely understood. A double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial comparing standard dosages of hydromorphone versus metoclopramide will be needed to definitively determine which medication

Rather than use standard measures of psychological well-being developed in Western nations and untested among Asian women, focus groups were conducted to develop an understanding of Indonesian women's perceptions of their own well-being. The focus group findings were used to develop 	41 questionnaire items	 to measure psychological well-being, and the questionnaire was administered to 796 women in Sumatra and Lampung. Factor analysis reduced the well-being variables into five factors accounting for 45% of the total variance: (1) general negative feelings; (2) satisfaction with relationships and ability to control fertility; (3) satisfaction with economic, family and personal conditions; (4) negative feelings regarding marital and domestic issues; and (5) ability to pursue activities outside the home.

Although some psoralens are therapeutically active in the treatment of cutaneous hyperproliferative diseases when combined with UVA (320-400 nm) radiation, the toxic effects of these compounds have led physicians to seek new photochemotherapeutic agents. One such agent is 4,4',5'-trimethylazapsoralen (TMAP), a new bifunctional psoralen compound. We investigated the effects of repetitive treatments with TMAP plus UVA radiation on 	the number	 of dendritic immune cells in murine epidermis and on the induction of phototoxicity. Mice treated 3 times per week for 4 weeks with 129 microgram TMAP plus 10 kJ/m2 UVA radiation exhibited no gross or microscopic evidence of phototoxicity. During this treatment, the numbers of ATPase+, Ia+, and Thy-l+ dendritic epidermal cells were greatly reduced, and by the end of the treatment period, few dendritic immune cells could be detected.

Pro-inflammatory cytokines trigger their conversion to a classically activated (M1) phenotype, sustaining inflammation and producing a cytotoxic environment. Conversely, anti-inflammatory cytokines polarize the cells towards an alternatively activated (M2), tissue reparative phenotype. Elucidation of the signal transduction pathways involved in M1 to M2 phenotypic conversion may provide insight into how the innate immune response can be harnessed during distinct phases of disease or injury to mediate neuroprotection and neurorepair. METHODS: Microglial cells (cell line and primary) were subjected to combined 	cyclic adenosine monophosphate	 (cyclic AMP) and IL-4, or either alone, in the presence of pro-inflammatory mediators, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Their effects on the expression of characteristic markers for M1 and M2 microglia were assessed. Similarly, the M1 and M2 phenotypes of microglia and macrophages within the lesion site were then evaluated following a contusive spinal cord injury (SCI) to the thoracic (T8) spinal cord of rats and mice when the agents were administered systemically. RESULTS: It was demonstrated that cyclic AMP functions synergistically with IL-4 to promote M1 to M2 conversion of microglia in culture. The combination of cyclic

The potential clinical implications of complete nodal staging are far-reaching, and give us a major new opportunity to stratify male patients with breast cancer for appropriate surgery as well as giving valuable prognostic information. Male breast cancer has biological differences compared with female breast cancer. It responds to hormonal manipulation and chemotherapy, but optimal treatment regimens in males are unknown. By 	analogy	 to the female breast cancer, post-mastectomy radiotherapy should be proposed in case of advanced T stage and/or lymph node positivity (considering the small volume of the male mammary gland, we suggest post-mastectomy irradiation in case of T >1 cm and/or presence of >1 metastatic axillary lymph node). Breast conserving surgery, performed in selected cases of male breast cancer, should be always followed by radiotherapy. Despite a wealth of small retrospective studies on MBC, its rarity means there is a lack of prospective randomized controlled treatment trials, which needs to be addressed if significant advances are to be made in the

The rat model of carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4))-induced hepatic fibrosis was used to assess the effect of daily intraperitoneal injections of EGCG on the indexes of fibrosis. Histological and hepatic hydroxyproline examination revealed that EGCG significantly arrested progression of hepatic fibrosis. EGCG caused significant amelioration of liver injury (reduced activities of serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase). The development of CCl(4)-induced hepatic fibrosis altered the redox state with a decreased hepatic glutathione and increased the formation of lipid peroxidative products, which were partially normalized by treatment with 	EGCG	, respectively. Moreover, EGCG markedly attenuated HSC activation as well as matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 activity. In cultured stellate cell, the expression of MMP-2 mRNA and protein were substantially reduced by EGCG treatment. Concanavalin A-induced activation of secreted MMP-2 was inhibited by EGCG through the influence of membrane type 1-MMP activity. These results demonstrate that administration of EGCG may be useful in the treatment and prevention of hepatic fibrosis. DOCEND

We found that stimulation of human corneal epithelial cells with hypoxic stress suppressed a high molecular mass form of CTCF (150 kDa), but not a lower molecular weight form of CTCF (130 kDa). Further investigation revealed that the hypoxic stress-suppressed 150-kDa CTCF was a small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO)ylated form of the protein. Hypoxic stress-induced de-SUMOylation of human CTCF was associated with lysine 74 and 689 residues, but not to the phosphorylation of CTCF. Overexpression of 	SENP1	 induced de-SUMOylation of CTCF. However, knockdown of SENP1 could not rescue hypoxic stress-induced CTCF de-SUMOylation. Overexpression of SUMO1 and SUMO2 increased SUMOylation of CTCF and partially blocked hypoxic stress-induced CTCF de-SUMOylation, suggesting that free cellular SUMO proteins play roles in regulating hypoxia-induced CTCF de-SUMOylation. In addition, hypoxic stress significantly inhibited PAX6 mRNA and protein expressions by suppression of PAX6-P0 promoter activity. The result was further supported by data showing that knockdown of CTCF significantly enhanced expression of PAX6 and abolished hypoxia-induced suppression of PAX6. Thus, we conclude that hypoxic stress induces de-SUMOylation of CTCF to functionally regulate CTCF activity. DOCEND

To avoid these treatment complications but safely protect against DFP-induced seizures and other CNS toxicity, we adopted the strategy of administering mice with (i) small doses of huperzine A (HUP), a reversible and long-lasting (half-life approximately 5 h) inhibitor of AChE, and (ii) imidazenil (IMI), a potent positive allosteric modulator of GABA action selective for alpha(5)-containing GABA(A) receptors. Coadministration of HUP (50 microg/kg s.c., 15 min before DFP) with IMI (2 mg/kg s.c., 30 min before DFP) prevents DFP-induced convulsions and the associated neuronal damage and mortality, allowing complete recovery within 	18-24 h	. In HUP-pretreated mice, the ED(50) of IMI to block DFP-induced mortality is approximately 10 times lower than that of DZP and is devoid of sedation. Our data show that a combination of HUP with IMI is a prophylactic, potent, and safe therapeutic strategy to overcome DFP toxicity. DOCEND
12174925	T7	dis	A fractal dimension analysis: a new method for evaluating the response of anticancer therapy. BACKGROUND: The therapeutic effects of various anticancer therapies on malignant tumors are evaluated as objective response (OR) by comparing the tumor size before and after the therapy However, it is difficult to evaluate the OR because malignant tumors frequently have very irregular or stellate shapes. In the present study we investigated a new method for evaluating the response of esophageal cancer to radio-chemotherapy using the fractal dimension (FD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The changes in tumor size or shape during therapy were recorded in 6 patients with 	esophageal cancer	 by esophageal fluoroscopy. The OR was evaluated by WHO standard criteria by calculating the tumor regression rate (TRR), while the FD was calculated by a standard compass-counting method. RESULTS: All 6 patients complained of dysphagia before therapy, but the food passage improved after therapy in all patients. The TRR after therapy ranged between -90% and 43.4%, and the OR was evaluated as no change (NC) in 5 patients and progressive disease (PD) in one patient. On the other hand, the RD gradually decreased in all 6 patients during the therapy. Furthermore, 5 patients underwent esophagectomy and the histological effect was

DESIGN: Adolescents' diurnal cortisol levels on a normal day and cortisol levels during a stress procedure were examined in relation to the age of onset of alcohol use. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: All adolescents (aged 14-20 years) were part of a general population study in the Netherlands (n = 2286). MEASUREMENTS: Ten assessments of salivary cortisol taken on a normal day (diurnal cortisol), as well as during a social stress procedure (stress cortisol) were used as indicators of HPA axis activity. FINDINGS: The age at which the first alcoholic drink was consumed varied as 	a function	 of cortisol levels at the onset of as well as during the stress procedure. Those who began drinking at an earlier age showed lower cortisol levels at the onset of the stressful tasks (r(2) = 0.14, P < 0.001) and during the stressful tasks (r(2) = 0.10, P < 0.05), although not after the tasks (cortisol recovery). Effects were strongest for anticipatory pre-task cortisol levels. Differences in diurnal cortisol levels did not explain variance in the age at which adolescents had begun drinking. CONCLUSIONS: Lessened activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis at the onset of and during a stress procedure is present in adolescents who

The hibernating and food deprived jerboas exhibited a significant increase (130%; P<0.05 and 210%; P<0.01, respectively) of mRNA expression as compared with controls. This elevated NPY mRNA expression supports the hypothesis that NPY may be implicated in abnormal feeding behaviour associated with eating deprivation. The stimulation of NPY gene expression in hibernating jerboas may be related to food deprivation and / or cold exposure since NPY is known

OBJECTIVES: The objective of our project was to develop a lifestyle program for leg ulcer patients at outpatient clinics for dermatology. METHODS: We used the intervention-mapping (IM) framework for systematically developing theory and evidence based health promotion programs. We started with a needs-assessment. A multidisciplinary project group of health care workers and patients was involved in all five IM steps; formulating proximal program objectives, selecting methods and strategies, producing program components, planning for adoption and implementation and planning for 	evaluation	. Several systematic literature reviews and original studies were performed to support this process. RESULTS: Social Cognitive Theory was selected as the main theory behind the program 'Lively Legs' and was combined with elements of Goal-Setting Theory, the precaution adoption model and motivational interviewing. The program is conducted through health counseling by dermatology nurses and was successfully pre-tested. Also, an implementation and evaluation plan were made.

The aim of this research was to study exogenous prostacyclin effect on urinary kallikrein excretion (UKK) in man, to define whether prostacyclin-induced renin release and/or endogenously released cyclooxygenase products were responsible for prostacyclin-induced enhancement of UKK, to determine furosemide effect on UKK. Prostacyclin was infused in eight healthy men and repeated after propranolol and indomethacin treatment. Prostacyclin caused a dose-dependent increase of UKK. Pretreatment with propranolol and indomethacin did not affect prostacyclin-induced enhancement of UKK, although it reduced absolute values of plasma renin activity. Furosemide increased UKK and simultaneously urinary 	6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha	. We conclude that prostacyclin induces an increase in UKK in a dose-dependent manner; furosemide-induced renal prostacyclin synthesis is temporally related to enhancement of UKK; partial dissociation of UKK from plasma renin activity under propranolol and indomethacin treatment and in response to furosemide might suggest a direct effect of prostacyclin on UKK.

Noncyclic acetal moieties in general permitted retention of pharmacological activity, as did concomitant replacement of the central biphenyl "spacer" by other bulky cyclic groupings and replacement of the oxazinium rings by piperidine or 4-methylpiperidine. However, these modifications generally produced compounds of a lower potency.

Here, we reveal a strong positive correlation between expression of HOXA1 and of members of the TNF/NF-kappaB pathway in breast tumor datasets. Functionally, we demonstrate that HOXA1 can activate NF-kappaB and operates upstream of the NF-kappaB inhibitor IkappaB. Consistently, we next demonstrate that the HOXA1-mediated activation of NF-kappaB is non-transcriptional and that RBCK1 and TRAF2 influences on NF-kappaB are epistatic to 	HOXA1	. We also identify an 11 Histidine repeat and the homeodomain of HOXA1 to be required both for RBCK1 and TRAF2 interaction and NF-kappaB stimulation.

E2 administration (i.v.) resulted in a significant increase in serum PRL within 4 h; however, cocaine or mazindol administration abolished the E2-induced increase of PRL. Cocaine or mazindol significantly increased the concentration of DA at the site of the axon terminals within the median eminence (ME), intermediate lobe (IL) and neural lobe (NL), indicating blockade of uptake. Because formation of DOPAC requires uptake of DA, concentrations of DOPAC in the ME, IL and NL decreased following treatment with either 	cocaine	 or mazindol. These data, together with the presence of immunopositive DAT in the ME, pituitary stalk, IL, and NL, suggest that a functional DAT system is present within all three populations of NEDA neurons. Moreover, similarity between the effects of cocaine and mazindol treatment indicate that blockade of the DAT, but not other amine transporters, is responsible for suppression of PRL gene expression and secretion.

METHODS: Structured demographic and clinical data were obtained regarding all adult patients treated at all maintenance dialysis facilities (n=39) in Libya from May to September 2009. Subsequently data were collected prospectively on all new patients who started dialysis from September 2009 to August 2010. Population estimates were obtained from the Libyan national statistics department. The age and gender breakdown of the population in each region was obtained from mid-2009 population estimates based on 2006 census data. RESULTS: The prevalence of dialysis-treated ESKD was 624 per 	million population (pmp)	. 85% of prevalent patients were aged <65 years and 58% were male. The prevalence of ESKD varied considerably with age with a peak at 55-64 years (2475 pmp for males; 2197 pmp for females). The annual incidence rate was 282 pmp with some regional variation and a substantially higher rate in the South (617 pmp). The most common cause of ESKD among prevalent and incident patients was diabetes. Other important causes were glomerulonephritis, hypertensive nephropathy and congenital or hereditary diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Libya has a relatively high prevalence and incidence of dialysis-treated ESKD. As the country prepares to redevelop its healthcare

Designs, analyses and results of longitudinal studies of intelligence of patients treated early for 	phenylketonuria	 (PKU) are reviewed. All studies converge on the conclusion that after the age of 10 years, IQ development is stable for different degrees of dietary relaxation. On average, for each 300 mumol/l increase in blood phenylalanine (Phe) levels pre-school, IQ decreases by about half a standard deviation. Children with Phe levels below 400 mumol/l in early and middle childhood had the best outcomes which were near normal. PKU seems to suppress the global level of IQ without impairment of domain-specific competencies. For historical reasons there is no research on IQ development of early treated patients in middle or late adulthood,

Lidamycin (LDM) is a potent enediyne-containing antitumor antibiotic that now has entered phase II clinical trials. In this study, we prepared an engineered fusion protein, scFv-LDP, consisting of an anti-CD20 scFv fragment and the apoprotein LDP of LDM using DNA recombination. After purification and refolding, scFv-LDP was found to bind specifically to CD20-positive lymphoma cells using ELISA and indirect immunofluorescent cytochemical staining assays.

To address the basis for iron regulation of erythropoiesis, we established primary hematopoietic cultures with transferrin saturation levels that restricted erythropoiesis but permitted granulopoiesis and megakaryopoiesis. Experiments in this system identified as a critical regulatory element the aconitases, multifunctional iron-sulfur cluster proteins that metabolize citrate to isocitrate. Iron restriction suppressed mitochondrial and cytosolic aconitase activity in erythroid but not granulocytic or megakaryocytic progenitors. An active site aconitase inhibitor, fluorocitrate, blocked erythroid differentiation in a manner similar to iron deprivation. Exogenous isocitrate abrogated the erythroid iron restriction response in vitro and reversed 	anemia	 progression in iron-deprived mice. The mechanism for aconitase regulation of erythropoiesis most probably involves both production of metabolic intermediates and modulation of erythropoietin signaling. One relevant signaling pathway appeared to involve protein kinase Calpha/beta, or possibly protein kinase Cdelta, whose activities were regulated by iron, isocitrate, and erythropoietin. DOCEND

Wild jungle crows (Corvus macrorhynchos) captured from three different areas of Tokyo were examined to evaluate environmental contamination of dioxins. In addition to the pathologic examination of their whole body, 	accumulation	 of dioxins, mRNA expression of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), and pentoxyresorufin-O-depenthylase (PROD) activity in the liver were determined. Marked histopathologic changes were observed in the thyroid glands, especially in the crows from the urban downtown area. Levels of dioxins and their toxic equivalents (TEQs) and AhR mRNA expression in the livers of the crows from the urban area were higher than those from the suburban area. There was a high correlation between the levels of TEQs and PROD activity. The results of the present study demonstrated that jungle crows possess AhR-mediated toxicologic pathways similar to those of mammals and

Patients from 76 independent families with various forms of mostly central retinal dystrophies were screened for mutations in the RDS/peripherin gene by means of SSCP analysis and direct DNA sequencing. Two nonsense mutations (Gln239ter, Tyr285ter), five missense mutations (Arg172Trp, Lys197Glu, Gly208Asp, Trp246Arg, Ser289Leu), and one single base insertion (Gly208insG), heterozygous in all cases, were detected. Only one of these mutations, Arg172Trp, has been reported previously. Cosegregation of the mutation with the disease phenotype could be established in selected families. 	Other missense mutations	 were excluded from a panel of 55-75 control subjects. The patients showed remarkable variation in phenotype and disease expression not only between cases with different mutations but also between affected members of the same family. This study indicates that RDS/peripherin mutations are a frequent cause of various types of central retinal dystrophies and that the RDS/peripherin gene exhibits a broad spectrum of allelic mutations. Comparative analysis of known mutations allowed us to hypothesise that the deleterious effect of RDS/peripherin gene mutations is the result of different molecular mechanisms. DOCEND

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: One of the most striking humoral characteristics of the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies is the specific targeting of components of the translational machinery by the immune system. The most commonly targeted of these components are the aminoacyl tRNA synthetase (ARS) molecules. However, 	the relation	 between the immune responses to these molecules and the pathogenesis of the inflammatory myopathies remains obscure. This review will examine recent evidence that explores the links between the ARS molecules, inflammation, and apoptosis, with the aim of furthering our current understanding of the underlying pathogenesis of the myositis syndromes. RECENT FINDINGS: Several of the ARS molecules and their proteolytic fragments generated during inflammation and apoptosis have recently been shown to possess chemoattractant properties. The liberation of these fragments in the muscle microenvironment under certain circumstances may provide a proinflammatory context and lead to the influx of lymphocytes, macrophages, and specialized

Further characterization and fractionation of the screening positives from the primary assay led to the discovery of a depside, anziaic acid, from the lichen Hypotrachyna sp. as an inhibitor for both 	Y. pestis	 and Escherichia coli topoisomerase I. In in vitro assays, anziaic acid exhibits antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis and a membrane permeable strain of E. coli. Anziaic acid was also found to act as an inhibitor of human topoisomerase II but had little effect on human topoisomerase I. This is the first report of a depside with activity as a topoisomerase poison inhibitor and demonstrates the potential of this class of natural products as a source for new antibacterial and anticancer compounds.

Group differences (patients vs. siblings) were examined on the SCT behaviors and partial correlations were conducted to explore the relationship of the SCT behaviors with IQ and achievement, while controlling for age at treatment and time since treatment. RESULTS: ALL survivors exhibited significantly more SCT symptoms than the sibling control group and increased SCT symptoms were associated with 	lower IQ and achievement scores	.

Using number of affected siblings as a covariable, both IAR and IA-2 antibodies were significantly associated with progression to IDDM (p < 0.005). Combinations of both antibodies, however, did not result in a significantly stronger association with progression to IDDM. The threshold of positivity for IAR Ab (0.5 units) and IA-2 Ab (3.0 units) assays was adjusted to give the same specificity (97.9%) for each assay in 144 healthy control subjects, to allow standardised comparisons. Levels of IAR Ab and IA-2 Ab were strongly correlated in 53 recent-onset 	IDDM	 patients (r = 0.70, p < 0.0001) but 11.3% had IAR Ab in the absence of IA-2 Ab and 16.9% had IA-2 Ab in the absence of IAR Ab. The sensitivity for IDDM (defined as the proportion of IDDM patients positive) was 56.6% for IAR Ab and 62.3% for IA-2 Ab. We conclude that there is considerable overlap in IA-2 Ab and IAR Ab positivity, although either antibody can occur independently in IDDM patients. Both IAR Ab and IA-2 antibodies are associated with progression to IDDM in first-degree relatives at-risk of IDDM, but the use of IAR and IA-2 antibodies in combination

Extent and determinants of patient delay of diagnosis in breast cancer patients and its impact on stage of disease were examined in a population based study among female breast cancer patients in Germany. Two hundred and eighty-seven women, aged 18 to 80 years with newly diagnosed invasive symptomatic breast cancer, were interviewed with respect to the diagnostic process. Patient delay was defined as time from onset of first symptoms to first consultation of 	a doctor	. Median patient delay was 16 days among symptomatic patients. Eighteen per cent of all breast cancer patients waited longer than 3 months before consulting a physician. Long patient delay was associated with old age, history of a benign mastopathy, obesity, and indices of health behaviour such as not knowing a gynaecologist for out-patient care and non-participation in general health screening examinations. A strong association between patient delay and stage at diagnosis was observed for poorly differentiated tumours. These results suggest that at risk groups for delaying consultation can be identified and that a substantial proportion of late stage diagnoses of

We show that the integrability of the obtained field can be improved dramatically through a simple desaturation of the color image (as in the HSV color space). This result can be readily extended to multispectral images by defining an analogue to saturation. We present several results explaining what happens to color tensors as the saturation changes. Significantly we show that small changes of the saturation in the linear image space can result in large improvements in the integrability of tensor gradients calculated in logarithmic color space. 	This result	 is important for two reasons. 1) Log-differences are more perceptually meaningful. 2) In log-space we can operate with retinex algorithms, which are well known techniques for contrast enhancement. We propose that they can be used to "put back" any contrast that might be lost in the desaturation step and, more importantly, they can enhance contrast at the same time as reintegrating the gradient field because of their relation to partial differential equations. Finally, we evaluate our method psychophysically. Compared with other commonly used image fusion methods, experiments show that our data fusion using the Di Zenzo color tensor after desaturating

We investigated the signal transduction mechanism of IL-6 in cultured rat mesangial cells. IL-6 induced a transient increase of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins 1,4,5-P3) followed by a transient and sustained increase of intracellular calcium concentration, suggesting that IL-6 stimulates phosphoinositide turnover. IL-6 also stimulated prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production. The 	IL-6	-concentration dependency in PGE2 production was similar to that in Ins 1,4,5-P3 production.

A range of adiposity exposures were considered, including BMI (continuous and categorical), waist circumference, body fat percentage, and waist-to-hip ratio, and the outcome was all-cause mortality. We used Cox regression models adjusted for age, smoking status, deprivation index, education, and disease history.

The obesity paradox was pronounced in current smokers, absent in never smokers, and more pronounced in men than in women. For other adiposity measures, there was less evidence for an obesity paradox, yet smoking status consistently modified the adiposity-mortality relationship.

Conversely, rNefs mutated in domains critical for the interaction with the endocytotic machinery (i.e., EE155-156QQ, and DD174-175AA) were ineffective. Interestingly, we found that the Nef-dependent release of inflammatory factors correlated with the activation of the NF-kappaB transcription factor, mainly in its p50/	p50	 homodimeric form, and in a de novo protein synthesis-independent manner.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this phase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 172 patients with metastatic CRC were randomised to receive once-daily cediranib (20 or 30 mg) or placebo, each combined with modified FOLFOX6 (mFOLFOX6). The primary objective was comparison of progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: The comparison of cediranib 20 mg versus placebo met the primary objective of PFS prolongation [hazard ratio = 0.70 (95% confidence interval 0.44-1.11), P = 0.167], which met the protocol-defined criterion of P < 0.2. Median PFS was 	10.2 versus 8.3 months	, respectively. The PFS comparison for cediranib 30 mg versus placebo did not meet the criterion. The most common adverse events (AEs) in the cediranib-containing groups were diarrhoea and hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: Cediranib 20 mg plus mFOLFOX6 met the predefined criteria in terms of improved PFS compared with placebo plus mFOLFOX6.

INTRODUCTION: One of the most severe complications of repair surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) is acute kidney injury (AKI). Acute kidney injury is an inflammatory process whose pathogenesis involves endothelial cells (EC). The aim of this study was to assess the dynamics of endothelium injury markers measured during elective AAA surgery which might confirm the inflammatory character of AKI. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group consisted of 14 patients with AAA. We measured plasma soluble forms of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), 	vascular cell adhesion molecule-1	 (VCAM-1), E-selectin, P-selectin as well as the levels of von Willebrand factor (vWF) before, during (including intra-abdominal vein levels before and after aortic clamp removal) and within 2 days after surgery. RESULTS: We have found a biphasic response of ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and P-selectin with an initial fall and subsequent rise. However, only VCAM-1 changes were significant compared to its baseline value. The maximum decrease of VCAM-1 was observed in the renal vein 5 min after aortic clamp removal (335.42 +/-129.63 ng/ml vs. 488.90 +/-169.80 ng/ml baseline value, p < 0.05), and the highest rise 48 h after aortic clamp removal (721.46

Uranium's redox state often dictates whether it will reside in the aqueous or solid phase and thus plays 	an integral role	 in the mobility of uranium within the environment. In anaerobic environments, the more oxidized and mobile form of uranium (UO2(2+) and associated species) may be reduced, directly or indirectly, by microorganisms to U(IV) with subsequent precipitation of UO. However, various factors within soils and sediments, such as U(VI) speciation and the presence of competitive electron acceptors, may limit biological reduction of U(VI).

Choices of molecules substituted at the amino groups of the glucosamine units did affect the hydrophobicity of the film surface, as indicated by air-water contact angle analysis. The surface became more hydrophobic than that of non-modified film when a stearoyl group (C(17)H(35)CO-) was attached to the films. The reaction of chitosan films with succinic anhydride or phthalic anhydride, however, produced more hydrophilic films. Selected modified films were subjected to protein adsorption study. The amount of protein adsorbed, determined by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay, related to the types of attached molecules. The improved surface hydrophobicity affected by the 	stearoyl	 groups promoted protein adsorption. In contrast, selective adsorption behavior was observed in the case of the chitosan films modified with anhydride derivatives. Lysozyme adsorption was enhanced by H-bonding and charge attraction with the hydrophilic surface. While the amount of albumin adsorbed was decreased possibly due to negative charges that gave rise to repulsion between the modified surface and albumin. This study has demonstrated that it is conceivable to fine-tune surface properties which influence its response to bio-macromolecules by heterogeneous chemical modification. DOCEND

BACKGROUND: We have previously shown an increased incidence of intermittent hypoxemia (IH) events in preterm infants with severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Animal models suggest that patterns of IH events may play a role in ROP severity as well. We hypothesize that specific IH event patterns are associated with ROP in preterm infants. METHODS: Variability in IH event duration, severity, and 	the time	 interval between IH events (<=80%, >=10 s, and <=3 min) along with the frequency spectrum of the oxygen saturation (SpO2) waveform were assessed. RESULTS: Severe ROP was associated with (i) an increased mean and SD of the duration of IH event (P < 0.005), (ii) more variability (histogram entropy) of the time interval between IH events (P < 0.005), (iii) a higher IH nadir (P < 0.05), (iv) a time interval between IH events of 1-20 min (P < 0.05), and (v) increased spectral power in the range of 0.002-0.008 Hz (P < 0.05), corresponding to SpO2 waveform oscillations of 2-8 min in duration.

The cell-cycle regulatory gene INK4A-ARF (CDKN2A) has two alternative transcripts that produce entirely different proteins, namely p14(ARF) and p16, which have 	complementary functions	 as regulators of p53 and pRB tumor suppressor pathways, respectively. The unusual organization of INK4A-ARF has long led to speculation of a need for coordinated regulation of p14(ARF) and p16. We now show that p14(ARF) (ARF) regulates the stability of p16 protein in human cancer cell lines, as well as in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). In particular, ARF promotes rapid degradation of p16 protein, which is mediated by the proteasome and, more specifically, by interaction of ARF with one of its subunits, REGgamma. Furthermore, this ARF-dependent destabilization of p16 can be abrogated by knockdown of REGgamma or by pharmacologic blockade

Three different N-isopropylacrylamide polymer derivatives were synthesized by 	surfactant free emulsion polymerization	, and assessed in the terms of pH in the aqueous dispersions in the presence and absence oflidocaine hydrochloride. The tendency in observed system was similar at three different temperatures, when lidocaine was applied. The pH value increased from the range between 5,39 - 5,90 up to the range 6,22 - 6,55. However, the step of pH between the temperature of 25 degrees C and 32 degrees C was more radical, comparing to 32 degrees C and 45 degrees C.

METHODS: Measurements were taken before and after an 8-day treatment with spironolactone (200 mg/day), after an 8-day treatment with clonidine (0.150 mg/day) and 10 days after adjunction of spironolactone (200 mg/day) to clonidine.

Fibronectin (Fn) is produced by cells in blood vessels at inflammatory sites in vivo. Fn release into the circulation thus may be a marker for vascular injury. In support of this, we found that oxidant-induced vascular injury of isolated perfused rabbit lungs caused elevated circulating Fn levels. 	Western blot analysis	 indicated that Fn released from the injured blood vessels was intact, dimeric, and possessed electrophoretic mobility identical with Fn produced by fibroblasts. Unlike Fn isolated from rabbit plasma, Fn derived from lung perfusate or produced by fibroblasts reacted with antibodies raised to a synthetic peptide containing sequences from the extra type III Fn domain that is transcribed in fibroblasts but not hepatocytes. Vascular injury by protease was also associated with intravascular release of Fn, but with cleavage. Oxidant-induced vascular injury causes release of tissue-derived Fn, which can be distinguished from plasma Fn by its size and content of antigenic determinants

It is desirable to find methods of tipping the balance towards anti-inflammatory state. Estrogenic compounds have shown anti-inflammatory and also antioxidant activity. Astrocytes were pretreated with 17-beta estradiol or with genistein, and 48 h later treated with 5 microM amyloid beta (A beta) for 24 h. We found that A beta induces inflammatory mediators, such as cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (	TNF-alpha	). All these effects were prevented when cells were pretreated with estradiol or genistein, demonstrating anti-inflammatory effects of estradiol or genistein in astrocytes in primary culture. The A beta-stimulated expression of pro-inflammatory genes in cells is antagonized by the action of the PPARs (peroxisome proliferator activated receptors). Here we detected an increase in PPAR-gamma expression in astrocytes in primary culture treated with A beta and estradiol or soy isoflavone genistein. Thus, some of the anti-inflammatory effects of estrogenic compounds may be mediated and activated by PPARs suppressing a diverse array of inflammatory responses caused by A beta in astrocytes in primary

Sheep were killed 72 h after asphyxia. Magnesium sulfate infusion reduced electroencephalograph power and fetal movements before asphyxia. Magnesium sulfate infusion did not affect electroencephalograph power during recovery, but was associated with marked reduction of the post-asphyxial seizure burden (mean +/- SD: 34 +/- 18 min vs. 107 +/- 74 min, P < 0.05). 	Magnesium sulfate	 infusion did not affect subcortical neuronal loss. In the intragyral and periventricular white matter, magnesium sulfate was associated with reduced numbers of all (Olig-2+ve) oligodendrocytes in the intragyral (125 +/- 23 vs. 163 +/- 38 cells/field) and periventricular white matter (162 +/- 39 vs. 209 +/- 44 cells/field) compared to saline-treated controls ( P < 0.05), but no effect on microglial induction or astrogliosis. In conclusion, a clinically comparable dose of magnesium sulfate showed significant anticonvulsant effects after asphyxia in preterm fetal sheep, but did not reduce asphyxia-induced brain injury and exacerbated loss of oligodendrocytes.

Here we present an evolutionary model in which criticality naturally emerges from the need to balance between the two essential components of evolvability: phenotype conservation and phenotype innovation under mutations. We simulated the Darwinian evolution of random Boolean networks that mutate gene regulatory interactions and grow by gene duplication. The mutating networks were subjected to selection for networks that both (i) preserve all the already acquired phenotypes (dynamical attractor states) and (ii) generate new ones. 	Our results	 show that this interplay between extending the phenotypic landscape (innovation) while conserving the existing phenotypes (conservation) suffices to cause the evolution of all the networks in a population towards criticality. Furthermore, the networks produced by this evolutionary process exhibit structures with hubs (global regulators) similar to the observed topology of real gene regulatory networks. Thus, dynamical criticality and certain elementary topological properties of gene regulatory networks can emerge as a byproduct of the evolvability of the phenotypic landscape. DOCEND

METHODS: Leptin and leptin-binding activity (LBA) were measured in blood obtained from women who had a history of recurrent miscarriage (n = 53) during weeks 5-6 and 7-8 of pregnancy, and the concentrations were correlated with subsequent pregnancy outcome. RESULTS: Concentrations of leptin ranged from 1.4-62.8 ng/ml, but there was a strong correlation (r = 0.825, P < 0.001) between leptin values at weeks 5-6 and 7-8 in the same woman. Women who subsequently miscarried had significantly lower plasma 	leptin	 concentrations on both weeks 5-6 (13.34 +/- 2.1 ng/ml) (P < 0.05) and 7-8 (13.71 +/- 2.4 ng/ml) (P < 0.01) of pregnancy, than women who subsequently had a term birth (22.04 +/- 2.43 ng/ml week 5-6, 24.76 +/- 3.66 ng/ml week 7-8). LBA values ranged from 1-8.5% but there was no significant difference in LBA in blood obtained from women who subsequently miscarried or had a live birth.

This process enabled an isocratic operation of the simulated moving bed (SMB) system with a closed-loop set-up with refolding buffer as the desorbent buffer and buffer recycling by concentrating the raffinate using tangential flow filtration. With this continuous refolding process, we increased the refolding and cleavage yield of both model proteins by 10% compared to batch dilution refolding. Furthermore, more than 99% of the refolding buffer of the raffinate could be recycled which reduced the buffer consumption significantly. Based on the actual refolding data, we compared throughput, productivity, and buffer consumption between 	two batch dilution refolding processes	 - one using urea for IB dissolution, the other one using NaOH for IB dissolution - and our continuous refolding process.

Urethane is a widely used anesthetic for animal experiments. Although urethane is thought to minimally interfere with neurophysiological processes and appears to preserve synaptic signal transmission, it has also been reported to produce depressive effects on neuronal excitability. In the present study, we used electrophysiological recordings to investigate the effects of 	urethane	 on rat hippocampal CA1 neurons. Whole-cell recordings were employed in a brain slice preparation to record discharges in current-clamp mode and sEPSCs or mEPSCs in voltage-clamp mode. Urethane was found to significantly increase both the interspike interval and the coefficient of variation of the firing. Moreover, it was found that the inter-event intervals of sEPSC/mEPSCs were increased, but the amplitude and the kinetic properties (rise time and decay time) of the sEPSC/mEPSC were not altered by urethane, which implies that potassium leak currents were involved in such effects. The results suggest that urethane significantly suppresses activity of hippocampal CA1 neurons

The metabolic load exerted by expression of the aminoglycoside phosphotransferase was monitored by measuring ppGpp- and 	cAMP	-levels. Moreover, we revealed that JM108 is deficient of the Lon protease and thereby refined the genotype of JM108. The main consequences of Lon-deficiency with regard to plasmid DNA production are discussed herein. Additionally, we found that the expression of the aminoglycoside phosphotransferase, conferring resistance to kanamycin, was very high in plasmid DNA producing processes that actually inclusion bodies were formed. Thereby, a severe metabolic load on the host cell was imposed, detrimental for overall plasmid yield.

Masitinib also potently inhibited recombinant PDGFR and the intracellular kinase Lyn, and to a lesser extent, fibroblast growth factor receptor 3. In contrast, masitinib demonstrated weak inhibition of ABL and c-Fms and was inactive against a variety of other tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases. This highly selective nature of masitinib suggests that it will exhibit 	a better safety profile	 than other tyrosine kinase inhibitors; indeed, masitinib-induced cardiotoxicity or genotoxicity has not been observed in animal studies. Molecular modelling and kinetic analysis suggest a different mode of binding than imatinib, and masitinib more strongly inhibited degranulation, cytokine production, and bone marrow mast cell migration than imatinib. Furthermore, masitinib potently inhibited human and murine KIT with activating mutations in the juxtamembrane domain. In vivo, masitinib blocked tumour growth in mice with subcutaneous grafts of Ba/F3 cells expressing a juxtamembrane KIT mutant.

An oxidation current of 5-hydroxyindole signal was seen at 280-300 mV with differential normal pulse voltammetry. Noxious heat stimuli produced a mean signal increase over control values of 15.5 +/- 3.4% at 52 degrees C, and 7.2 +/- 5.5% at 45 degrees C. These increases lasted for 5-10 min. Non-noxious stimuli (37 degrees C) did not affect the 5-hydroxyindole signal. Morphine (0.5, 2.0 and 5.0 mg/kg, i.p.) in 	the absence	 of cutaneous stimulation did not change the signal significantly. Systemic morphine alone did not significantly modify the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) metabolism, as observed in in vivo voltammetry, in the spinal cord of anesthetized rat.

Modulation of cell-cell adhesion is crucial for regulating neuronal migration and maintenance of structural plasticity in the embryonic and mature brain. Such modulation can be obtained by the enzymatic attachment of polysialic acid (PSA) to the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) by means of the polysialyltransferases STX and PST. Thus, differential expression of STX and PST is likely to be responsible for varying functions of PSA-NCAM during neuronal differentiation, maintenance, plasticity, and regeneration. We have isolated the zebrafish homologues of STX (St8sia2) and PST (	St8sia4	) and demonstrate that their expression in the embryonic and adult nervous system is often confined to regions of neuronal migration. Moreover, in the adult cerebellum, the complementary expression pattern of both polysialyltransferases suggests a function in regulating cerebellar neuronal plasticity. Enzymatic removal of PSA in the embryonic cerebellum results in impaired neuronal migration, suggesting that PSA-NCAM is a key regulator of motility for cerebellar neuronal progenitors. DOCEND

We suggest that the 5-HT(2A/2C) receptor subtype plays an important role in the maintenance of UA stability and normal breathing in obesity, and we speculate that older obese Z rats may have augmented serotonergic control of UA dilator muscles as a mechanism to prevent pharyngeal collapse.

CONTEXT: Observational studies have suggested that postmenopausal hormone treatment may improve cognitive function, but data from randomized clinical trials have been sparse and inconclusive. The Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS) is an ancillary study of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) hormone therapy trials. On July 8, 	2002	, the estrogen plus progestin therapy in the WHI trial was discontinued because of certain increased health risks for women. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether estrogen plus progestin therapy protects global cognitive function in older postmenopausal women. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, WHIMS is an ancillary study of geographically diverse, community-dwelling women aged 65 years or older from 39 of 40 clinical centers within the WHI estrogen plus progestin trial that started in June 1995.

The nitrogen lone-pair electrons of OGR make it a donor, and electron transfer occurs to acceptor nitroaromatics causing fluorescence quenching, which is further promoted due to its acidity. The Stern-Volmer rate constants measured for different nitroaromatics showed that it senses picric acid (PA) best. The contact-mode technique with OGR-treated paper strips can allow naked-eye detection of PA under UV light down to 10-11 m concentration within 30 s. Reusability of the gel is achieved by treating OGR@PAx with 	NaOH	 solution. Impedance spectroscopic results indicated a decrease of both charge-transport resistance and Warburg impedance on successive addition of PA. The limits of detection of PA determined from fluorescence and impedance measurements match well. Thus, the OGR gel is a reusable, low-cost, specific sensor for PA by naked-eye colorimetric, fluorescence, and impedance techniques. DOCEND

We explored the possibility that ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels exist in urinary bladder smooth muscle, since synthetic openers (e.g., lemakalim) of KATP channels in other tissues relax bladder smooth muscle. Unitary currents through single potassium channels and whole cell potassium currents were measured in 	smooth muscle cells	 isolated from the detrusor muscle of the guinea pig bladder. Lemakalim (10 microM) increased whole cell K+ currents by 50 pA at -80 mV with 60 mM external K+ when the cells were dialyzed with 0.1 mM ATP and 140 mM K+. Glibenclamide (10 microM), a sulfonylurea blocker of KATP channels in other tissues, inhibited the entire lemakalim-stimulated current as well as 19 pA of the steady-state K+ current. Glibenclamide-sensitive K+ currents were not dependent on voltage. Increasing intracellular ATP from 0.1 to 3.0 mM reduced the glibenclamide-sensitive K+ current in both the presence and absence of lemakalim by about

We studied the effects of dl-alpha-difluoromethylarginine (DFMA) and dl-alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), specific, irreversible inhibitors of arginine decarboxylase (ADC) and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), respectively, on organogenesis growth and titers of free polyamines and conjugated putrescines (hydroxycinnamoyl putrescines) in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cv Xanthi n.c.) calli. These results suggest that ADC and ODC regulate putrescine biosynthesis during early and later stages of tobacco callus development, respectively. ADC appears active in biosynthesis of large levels of free amines (	agmatine	 and putrescine) while ODC appears active only in biosynthesis of large levels of putrescine conjugates (hydroxycinnamoyl putrescines). DFMA inhibits the fresh and dry weight increases of tobacco calli, whereas DFMO even promoted the fresh and dry weight increases, thus supporting the view that ADC is important for cell division and callus induction. Inhibition of ODC activity by DFMO resulting in an amide deficiency after 4 weeks of culture facilates the expression of differentiated cell functions. Formation of buds is associated with a significant decrease of hydroxycinnamoyl putrescines. DOCEND

The premedication was administered and evaluated in a double-blind fashion. The patients were anaesthetized with thiopentone, fentanyl, pancuronium, and ventilated with nitrous oxide in oxygen. The three premedications had no noticeable anxiolytic effect. Although there was no difference in the frequency of observed postoperative nausea and vomiting between 	the three groups	, premedication with dixyrazine nonetheless reduced the patients' experience of postoperative nausea as well as their need for postoperative antiemetics. Although patients in the two treatment groups were significantly more sedated immediately before induction of anaesthesia than patients receiving placebo, the degree of postoperative sedation was similar in all three groups. Morphine-scopolamine caused more postoperative dizziness than dixyrazine and placebo. Lack of recall was produced by both morphine-scopolamine and dixyrazine.

Regional distribution of GSK189254 in the rat brain was consistent to that of H3R distribution mapped using (3)H or (1)(1)C-GSK189254 in human, porcine, and rat.

The plasma EC50 values (ng/mL) were found to be 2.33, 292.2, and 3.54 for ciproxifan, thioperamide and GSK334429, respectively. DISCUSSION: Results from mass spectroscopy based approach to determine H3R occupancy in rat brain is comparable with reported radiolabeled method by scintillation spectroscopy. In conclusion, non-radiolabeled GSK189254 was successfully employed as a tracer for assessing the H3R occupancy in rats and it can be used as a preclinical tool for evaluation of novel H3R ligands in the drug discovery.

This paper specifically examines the co-occurrence of incontinence and two potential sources of trauma: sexual violence and female genital cutting using the most recent Demographic and Health Surveys in Malawi, Rwanda, Uganda and Ethiopia. Multivariate selection models are used to control for sampling differences by country. Results indicate that sexual violence is a significant determinant of incontinence in Rwanda and Malawi, however not in Uganda. Simulations predict that elimination of sexual violence would result in from a 7 to 	a 40% reduction	 of the total burden of incontinence. In contrast, no evidence is found that female genital cutting contributes to incontinence and this finding is robust for types of cutting and high risk samples. Results point to the importance of reinforcing prevention programs which seek to address prevention of sexual violence and for the integration of services to better serve women experiencing both sexual violence and incontinence.

Tissue sections were stained with diaminobenzidine following incubation with a primary antibody raised against ACTH1-24. There was positive staining for ACTH in cells scattered throughout the interstitium of ovaries from all species examined. Immunoreactive ACTH was observed in the oocytes of ovaries from 	humans	, cows, pigs, pregnant and non-pregnant sheep, but not from cats or rats. Positive staining of oocytes was associated with all tertiary and secondary follicles, and some primary follicles. There was no apparent difference in the pattern of staining between pregnant and non-pregnant sheep. Staining for ir-ACTH was absent in ovaries from fetal sheep. We conclude that ir-ACTH is present in ovarian tissue, and in particular the oocyte, from several species of mammal.

To clarify the control mechanism of these enzyme activities, we tried to clone cDNAs encoding alpha- and beta-subunit of CK2 and analyze the gene expressions. The deduced amino acid sequence of the isolated cDNAs comprised 	342 and 220 residues	, and these sequences showed 85-90% identities to the alpha- and beta-subunit of CK2 in Spodoptera frugiperda. RT-PCR indicated that these genes were expressed in nondiapause and diapause eggs. However, these genes expressions were not parallel with the changes in CK2 activity.

10986432	T39	out	DOCSTART Development of the placental villous tree and its consequences for fetal growth. Co-ordinated development of the fetal villous tree of the placenta is necessary for continued fetal growth and well-being. Before fetal viability, blood vessel development within the developing immature intermediate villi (IIV) is characterized by branching angiogenesis, such that the placenta expands to produce 10-16 generations of stem villi. Once fetal viability is attained, a developmental switch occurs to form large numbers of gas-exchanging terminal villi (	TV	) by non-branching angiogenesis in mature intermediate villi (MIV). Several growth factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), placenta growth factor (PlGF), angiopoietins, and angiostatins are produced within the villi and act locally, via their receptors, to control angiogenesis. Their relative contributions to placental vascular development are not fully understood at the present time. Severe early-onset intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is characterized by absent/reversed end-diastolic flow velocity (ARED) in the umbilical arteries, leading to fetal hypoxia, acidosis and a substantial rise in perinatal mortality and morbidity.

We report here that a synthetic polyunsaturated fatty acid, 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA), selectively inhibits the up-regulation of several genes on endothelial cells. ETYA suppresses endothelial cell activation by inhibiting the up-regulation of adhesion molecules like E-selectin. A runoff assay for E-selectin demonstrated that the suppression is at the level of transcription. The fact that ETYA inhibits E-selectin upon stimulation with a diverse group of stimuli like lipopolysaccharide, tumor necrosis factor-alpha or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, suggests that ETYA does not exert 	its effect	 by modifying membrane-bound receptors.

The transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and Wnt/wingless pathways play critical roles in the specification of cell fate during development and also contribute to cancer formation and progression. Whereas Wnt signaling is clearly pro-oncogenic, TGF-beta signaling is cell- and context-dependent, manifesting both inhibitory and proliferative effects. The growth factor, gastrin, has previously been shown to be a downstream target of the Wnt pathway and a promoter of gastrointestinal cancer. In this study, we show that the mouse gastrin promoter is regulated synergistically by TGF-beta/Smads and 	beta-catenin	/T-cell factor (TCF). Co-transfection of Smad3/Smad4 and beta-catenin expression constructs synergistically activated mouse gastrin promoter activity 30-60-fold in AGS cells with minimal effect seen with either construct alone. This activation was further potentiated by TGF-beta1 treatment. Mutating either the TCF binding site or the Smad-binding element (SBE) diminished the activation of gastrin expression by Smad3/Smad4 and beta-catenin and led to a loss of gastrin promoter responsiveness to TGF-beta1 treatment. Wnt and TGF-beta regulated endogenous gastrin mRNA levels in AGS cells in a similar fashion, as revealed by small interference RNA studies or overexpression of Smads and TCF4/beta-catenin.

A bout of vigorous physical activity can augment the immediate risk of a cardiac catastrophe by a factor of 5-100 depending on age, cardiac risk factors, and the physical and emotional circumstances of the participant. However, if a person engages regularly in such activity, the immediate risk is more than offset by an improvement in prognosis during intervening periods of rest. During 	demanding physical work	, there is a small but measurable risk of sudden death (3 to 7 episodes per 100,000 personnel per year). The risk associated with a brief (< 15 min) but vigorous occupational fitness assessment is so low as to preclude attempts to reduce it still further by direct medical supervision. If testing encourages an increase in personal fitness, any immediate increase in risk is enormously offset by a reduction in the number of cardiac deaths while resting. Furthermore, evidence is unconvincing that the average medical practitioner can prevent or treat any emergencies that may arise better than a well-trained professional fitness and

As expected, in the structure of the dinuclear species, two roughly perpendicular Cu(hfac) moieties are bound to a single ene-yne: one to the C[triple bond]C, the other to the conjuguated double bond. Weak intra- and intermolecular Cu...Cu interactions have been detected in the solid. [(hfac)Cu](2)(HY) is more stable and more easily formed than [(hfac)Cu](2)(MHY) because of the hindrance character of the additional methyl groups. The formation of the dinuclear species from the mononuclear species is reversible as it has been demonstrated by (1)H NMR. The mononuclear species can be recovered from the dinuclear species when free ene-yne base is added.

According to the cDNA sequences of human, mouse and rabbit NADP(H)-dependent retinol dehydrogenase/reductase (NRDR) gene, the gene-specific primers were designed and synthesized. In this study, we cloned the full-length cDNA of bovine liver NRDR by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and RT-PCR methods. The bovine NRDR cDNA is 1 266 bp and the ORF, like other NRDR cDNAs, is 783 bp, encoding 260 amino acid residues. The bovine NRDR exhibited the identity in amino acid sequence to those of human, mouse and rabbit NRDR. It contains short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (	SDR	) conservative motif and the peroxisomal targeting singal (PTS1) sequence at their C-terminal. In conclusion, the bovine NRDR cDNA was successfully cloned with RACE methods and submitted to GenBank(AF487454), whose nucleotide sequence and the deduced amino acid sequence were analyzed with Bioinformatics, that belongs to a novel peroxisomal SDR superfamily and plays an important role in the rate-limiting step of synthesizing retinoic acid.

METHODS: Patients with schizophrenia (n = 114 749) who received prescriptions for antipsychotic medication between 2008 and 2014 were retrospectively identified from the Korean National Health Insurance Service database. The study population was divided into three groups based on their age at the onset of schizophrenia (early, middle, and late onset). We assessed differences in the month of birth between patients and the general population. In addition, the cumulative clozapine use was calculated. RESULTS: Compared to the late-onset 	schizophrenia	 group, the early- and middle-onset groups showed a higher probability of birth during the winter season. In addition, the early-onset group showed the highest cumulative clozapine use rate. In the middle-onset group, the initiation of clozapine use was significantly earlier for patients born in winter compared to those born in summer. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the age at onset is an important factor in predicting the prognosis of schizophrenia patients. The season of birth also affects the prognosis, but with less robustness. Specifically, it appears that early disease onset and winter birth might be associated with poor outcomes in

In this study, we investigated the cell density-dependent induction of apoptosis of human acute myeloid leukemia U937 and ML-1 cells by disulfiram (DSF), the dithiocarbamate drug recently proposed for treatment of human cancers. This effect is dependent on uptake of extracellular copper and its intracellular accumulation.

To elucidate whether interleukin-18 (IL-18) or interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) participates in neurodegeneartion, we investigated the changes in IL-18 and IFN-gamma systems within the rat hippocampus following status epilepticus (SE). In non-SE induced animals, IL-18, IL-18 receptor alpha (IL-18Ralpha), IFN-gamma and IFN-gamma receptor alpha (IFN-gammaRalpha) immunoreactivity was not detected in the hippocampus. Following SE, 	IL-18	 immunoreactivity was increased in CA1-3 pyramidal cells as well as dentate granule cells. IL-18 immunoreactivity was also up-regulated in astrocytes and microglia/macrophages. IL-18Ralpha immunoreactivity was detected in astrocytes and microglia/macrophages. IFN-gamma immunoreactivity was detected only in astrocytes within all regions of the hippocampus. IFN-gammaRalpha immunoreactivity was increased in neurons as well as astrocytes. Intracerebroventricular infusions of recombinant rat IL-18 or IFN-gamma alleviated SE-induced neuronal damages, while neutralization of IL-18, IFN-gamma or their receptors aggravated them, as compared to saline-infused animals. These findings suggest that astroglial-mediated IFN-gamma pathway in response to IL-18 induction may play an important role in alleviation of

Testing during hospitalization was most common among injecting drug users (43%) and persons infected through heterosexual contact (50%). Persons primarily sought HIV testing because of illness (58%); other reasons included being in a known risk group (13%) and having had a known 	HIV	-infected sex partner (8%). Testing because of being in a known risk group was least common among persons infected through heterosexual contact (1%). Among persons in these exposure categories, testing differed by race/ethnicity. CONCLUSION: Most persons with AIDS were tested relatively late in their course of HIV infection, in acute health-care settings, and because of illness. Not knowing one's serostatus precludes early medical intervention and may increase transmission. DOCEND

It is shown here that genetic advance in one cycle of recurrent selection can be formulated directly in terms of covariances between relatives by application of the general statistical principle of linear prediction. For practical use of 	such formulae	 it is necessary to estimate the corresponding covariance between relatives from the mating design used. With General Combining Ability selection such estimation is direct. For other types of selection, it is necessary to derive associated covariances from other types of covariances but it is not necessary to use classical results of covariances between relatives in terms of genetic effects. Indeed, covariances can be derived without factorial decomposition of the genetic effects at one locus, i.e., without the concept of additivity and dominance. This approach allows a simple derivation of the genetic advance after n cycles of selection, followed by m

The parameters were then used as covariates in a link PK-PD model of cough suppression using data from all treatment arms. RESULTS: The best-fit PK model assumed two- and one-compartment PK models for DEX and DOR, respectively, and competitive inhibition of DEX metabolism by quinidine. The intrinsic clearance of DEX estimated from 	the model	 ranged from 59 to 1536 l x h(-1), which overlapped with that extrapolated from in vitro data (12-261 l x h(-1)) and showed similar variation (26- vs. 21-fold, respectively). The inhibitory effect of quinidine ([I]/Ki) was 19 (95% confidence interval of mean: 18-20) with an estimated average Ki of 0.017 microM. Although DEX and DOR were both active, the potency of the antitussive effect of DOR was 38% that of DEX.

MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: A tungsten electrode was placed in the left side of the DMV area and extracellular electrical signals from the electrode were recorded. Single unit nerve activity was identified by the discriminator. D-glucose infusion elevated the peripheral blood glucose concentration from 3.4-5.9 mm to 12.0-21.8 mm and the neural firing of the DMV was significantly reduced by D-glucose infusion. After the 30 min 	D-glucose	 infusion, saline was re-infused for 90 min. Blood glucose level returned to 6.5-7.8 m m and the neural firing partially recovered 90 min after the saline re-infusion. There was a significant negative correlation observed between the counts of neural spikes and blood glucose concentrations ( r=0.84, p<0.01). CONCLUSION: It is suggested that hyperglycemia impairs GI motility by inhibiting vagal efferent activity. A recent study in intensive care unit (ICU) patients demonstrated that uncontrolled hyperglycemia is associated with poor outcomes. We propose that glycemia control is crucial in ICU patients to maintain the GI motility and vagus nerve activity. DOCEND

METHODS: A multicentre observational study of adult and paediatric patients with CF (>10 years) treated for a physician-defined exacerbation of CF pulmonary symptoms. Measurements were performed at commencement and immediately after a course of intravenous antibiotics. Disease activity was assessed using 46 assays across five key domains: symptoms, lung physiology, structural changes on CT, pulmonary and systemic inflammatory markers. RESULTS: Statistically significant improvements were seen in forced expiratory volume in 	1 s	 (p<0.001, n=32), lung clearance index (p<0.01, n=32), symptoms (p<0.0001, n=37), CT scores for airway wall thickness (p<0.01, n=31), air trapping (p<0.01, n=30) and large mucus plugs (p=0.0001, n=31), serum C-reactive protein (p<0.0001, n=34), serum interleukin-6 (p<0.0001, n=33) and serum calprotectin (p<0.0001, n=31). DISCUSSION: We identify the key biomarkers of inflammation, imaging and physiology that alter alongside symptomatic improvement following treatment of an acute CF exacerbation. These data, in parallel with our study of biomarkers in patients with stable CF, provide important guidance in choosing optimal biomarkers for novel therapies. Further, they highlight that such acute therapy predominantly improves large airway

The nucleotide sequence of the 35-bp minisatellite was highly AT-rich and nearly identical to the 33-bp one but with insertion of two nucleotides, thymine and adenine. The copy number of the AT-rich minisatellite was 21 in total in the carrier, while only a few copies of the 33-bp minisatellite were present in a non-carrier Japanese subject. These results suggest that the molecular mechanism involved in the allelic expansion of the minisatellite repeat in FRA16B recognizes both minisatellites, the 33-bp one and the 35-bp one, as an amplicon. These observations were different from the ones at 	folate	-sensitive fragile sites, where the CCG triplet repeat was commonly involved in the allelic expansion. Although a slight reduction in AT content (95% > 90%) in the region of minisatellite expansion in the carrier subject was observed, both AT-content and length of the highly AT-rich region seem to play important roles in the cytogenetic expression of the distamycin A-inducible fragile site. In another normal subject, without fragile site expression, allelic expansion involving the 33-bp minisatellite was observed, and the length of the AT-rich DNA region was increased up to approximately 1000 bp. Since the length of the AT-rich minisatellite region was

METHODS: Inhaled nitric oxide (80 ppm) was administered before tourniquet application and continued throughout reperfusion until the completion of surgery. Venous blood samples were collected before and after reperfusion, for the measurements of nitrate and nitrite, CD11b/CD18, soluble P-selectin, and lipid hydroperoxide. Muscle biopsies were obtained from the quadriceps muscle before skin closure and analyzed for myeloperoxide, conjugated dienes, and nuclear factor-kappaB translocation. RESULTS: Administration of inhaled nitric oxide (80 ppm) significantly attenuated the inflammatory response characterized by 	reduced expression	 of CD11b/CD18, P-selectin, and nuclear factor kappaB compared with the control group. This was accompanied by increased plasma levels of nitrate and nitrite and reduced oxidative stress. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of inhaled nitric oxide at 80 ppm significantly reduces inflammation in lower extremity ischemia-reperfusion in humans. This observation supports the concept that during diseases characterized by dysfunction in nitric oxide metabolism, inhaled nitric oxide may be an effective therapy to replenish systemic nitric oxide, thus retarding inflammatory-mediated injury.

INTRODUCTION: The aim of the present work was to analyze the possibility of creating a light-storing photocatalyst material, a system that couples a phosphorescent substrate with a titania coating. The substrate could activate the titanium dioxide coating even in condition of darkness thanks to its light emission. This improvement of absorption can be achieved because the titania semiconductor is irradiated both by the direct light and by the luminescent substrate which is activated at the same time.

The cold-induced amylase release was observed in the absence of extracellular calcium, and calcium ionophore A23187 neither enhanced nor inhibited it. Treatments with cytochalasin D, phalloidin, or taxol did not disturb the release. Cold treatment did not increase the leakage of lactate dehydrogenase, a cytosolic enzyme, and the acini still maintained normal responsiveness to isoproterenol. Electron-microscopic observation revealed that the plasma membrane and zymogen granules of cold-exposed acini were intact, but many acinar lumina were distended with secretory materials.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was introduced nearly 20 years ago and has since been developed as a sophisticated tool for neuroscience research. It is an excellent technique that complements other non-invasive methods for studying 	human	 brain physiology. The aim of the present study was to review the basic concepts and principles of the repetitive TMS (rTMS) technique, gathering evidence of its applications in neurorehabilitation. Several clinical studies have reported that sessions of rTMS can improve some or all of the motor symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease, dystonia and stroke. However, since these changes are transient, it is premature to propose these applications as realistic therapeutic options, even though the rTMS technique has shown itself to be, potentially, a modulator of sensorimotor integration and neurogenesis.

Damage to this collagen framework of the heart is responsible for the final disarray of myocytes, with a parallel effect to the myocytolytic actions of ischemia within the very structure of each cell. Hence, the appearance of postinfarction ventricular aneurysms seems to be related to failure in normal repair processes resulting from maturation of new collagen tissue into the area of myocardial necrosis. It has been shown that, besides the well-known actions on chondrocytes, hypothalamic-hypophyseal 	human	 growth hormone and somatomedins activate the fibroblasts. Administration of human growth hormone resulted in a significant decrease in the incidence of ventricular aneurysms.

Concentrations of double-stranded RNA above about 0.1 mug/ml inhibit translation of encephalo-myocarditis viral RNA and mouse globin messenger RNA in extracts of Krebs II ascites cells. Protein synthesis initially proceeds at the control rate, then abruptly shuts off in a manner similar to that observed in reticulocyte lysates [Hunt, T. & Ehrenfeld, E. (	1971	) Nature New Biol. 230, 91-94]. Substantially higher concentrations of double-stranded RNA are required to give this effect in ascites extracts. Subcellular fractions of Krebs II ascites cells contain a nucleolytic activity capable of digesting several natural and synthetic double-stranded RNAs. This nuclease is most active under conditions of protein synthesis, and part of the activity remains associated with ribosomes upon sedimentation. It is probably because of digestion of double-stranded RNA by this nuclease that higher concentrations of double-stranded RNA are required for inhibition of protein synthesis in Krebs cell extracts than in reticulocyte lysates.

Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), an enzyme involved in TCE metabolism, was localized in the epididymal epithelium and testicular Leydig cells, and was found at higher levels in the former than the latter. Immunoblotting confirmed that CYP2E1 protein was present in greater amounts in epididymis than in testis. p-Nitrophenol hydroxylation, a CYP2E1 catalytic activity, was also higher in the epididymis than in the testis. Chloral, a major TCE metabolite, was generated in microsomal incubations at significantly higher levels in epididymis than in testis. Antibody inhibition of 	CYP2E1	 reduced chloral formation, which was more pronounced in epididymis than in testis. After 4 weeks of TCE exposure, damage to the epididymis was manifested as sloughing of epithelial cells.

OBJECTIVES: Recent studies have reported a strong independent association between increased red cell distribution width (RDW) and the risk of adverse outcomes in patients with heart failure, stable coronary disease, and acute coronary syndromes. However, in this study we aimed to determine the impact of an elevated RDW level on the postinterventional thrombolysis in 	myocardial infarction	 (TIMI) flow and intrahospital mortality in patients with acute anterior myocardial infarction (AMI). METHODS: A total of 763 patients with acute AMI undergoing a primary percutaneous coronary intervention were evaluated retrospectively. Upon admission, the RDW level was measured by an automated complete blood count. Postinterventional TIMI flow and intrahospital mortality was documented for all patients from hospital registries. The patients were classified according to the RDW level. RDW more than 14.8% was defined as elevated RDW. All groups were compared statistically according to the preinterventional characteristics.

Based on amino acid composition and NH2- and COOH-terminal sequence analysis p12, pp18, p30, and p10 are distinct from one another, whereas pp20 is likely identical to pp18 in primary structure. The 	p12	 was resistant to Edman degradation and was found to be myristylated at the NH2-terminal amino group. Sequence comparisons among the retrovirus family show that pp18/pp20 and p10 are, respectively, homologs of phospho-proteins and nucleic acid-binding proteins. A comparison of terminal sequences with the nucleotide sequence of spleen necrosis virus (SNV) revealed that the gag genes of SNV and REV-A are highly conserved; together with the identification of REV-A gag-precursor polyprotein, Pr60gag in immunoprecipitates of radiolabeled cell lysates, this comparison also led to the establishment of the organization of Pr60gag, viz., NH2-p12-pp18-p30-p10-OH.

Narcolepsy, for example, has well defined pathophysiologic and diagnostic criteria, including low levels of hypocretin in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and specific findings on a polysomnography/multiple sleep latency test (PSG/MSLT). For these patients, life-long therapy is the norm and involves initiating treatment usually with modafinil, armodafinil, or sodium oxybate, with methylphenidate, 	amphetamine	-like stimulants, atomoxetine, or antidepressants used as second-line therapy. Pharmacologic therapy is usually done in concert with behavioral modifications such as scheduled napping for the best response. On the other hand, the etiology and pathophysiology of non-hypocretin-related hypersomnias (eg, idiopathic hypersomnia, Kleine-Levine syndrome) are unknown. For these reasons, treatment of these disorders is more challenging and less well defined. A trial of modafinil or armodafinil may be considered as first line therapy along with behavioral modifications.

A membrane fraction derived therefrom is labeled either with the opioid agonist, 3H-etorphine or with the opioid antagonist, 3H-diprenorphine, and solubilized with digitonin. Centrifugation of the soluble extracts in linear sucrose gradients reveals that bound 3H-etorphine sediments faster than does bound 3H-diprenorphine: 12S vs 10S. Pre-incubation of membranes and radioligand in the presence of 120 mM 	NaCl	 results in considerably decreased recovery of the 3H-agonist in 12S form while recovery of the 3H-antagonist in 10S form is substantially increased. The opposite situation is observed when the membranes have been prelabeled with radioligand in the presence of 1 mM MnCl2. Guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate, a metabolically stable structural analog of GTP is found to selectively reduce recovery of labeled 12S receptors while it does not affect that of labeled 10S receptors. These data indicate that the mu-opioid receptor from rabbit cerebellum is capable of existing in two forms which differ in apparent molecular size: an "antagonist" (10S) form of apparent

The Ka apparent value for dopamine was increased by the D-1 antagonist cis-flupenthixol, 25 and 100 nM, to 23 and 190 microM, respectively, but was unaffected by propranolol (1 microM). Noradrenaline stimulation of adenylate cyclase was only partially inhibited by either propranolol (10 microM) or cis-flupenthixol (1 microM). Propranolol (10 microM), but not cis-flupenthixol (1 microM), prevented stimulation by isoprenaline. The stimulation of adenylate cyclase by dopamine and noradrenaline remained unchanged in the presence of phentolamine (1 microM) and sulpiride (1 microM). These results suggest

Formation and subsequent evolution of gas bubbles in blood and tissues of subjects exposed to decompression are casual processes in their nature. Such character of bubbling processes in a body predetermines probabilistic character of decompression sickness (DCS) incidence in 	divers	, aviators and astronauts. Our original probabilistic theory of decompression safety is based on stochastic models of these processes and on the concept of critical volume of a free gas phase in body tissues. From positions of this theory, the probability of DCS incidence during single-stage decompressions and during hypobaric decompressions under EVA in particular, is defined by the distribution of possible values of nucleation efficiency in "pain" tissues and by its critical significance depended on the parameters of a concrete decompression. In the present study the following is shown: 1) the dimensionless index of critical nucleation efficiency for "pain" body

A fundamental paradox in bone mechanobiology is that tissue-level strains caused by human locomotion are too small to initiate intracellular signaling in osteocytes. A cellular-level strain-amplification model previously has been proposed to explain this paradox. However, the molecular mechanism for initiating signaling has eluded 	detection	 because none of the molecules in this previously proposed model are known mediators of intracellular signaling. In this paper, we explore a paradigm and quantitative model for the initiation of intracellular signaling, namely that the processes are attached directly at discrete locations along the canalicular wall by beta(3) integrins at the apex of infrequent, previously unrecognized canalicular projections. Unique rapid fixation techniques have identified these projections and have shown them to be consistent with other studies suggesting that the adhesion molecules are alpha(v)beta(3) integrins.

An urgent need exists for the discovery and development of new, safe, and effective drugs to treat HAT, as existing therapies suffer from poor safety profiles, difficult treatment regimens, limited effectiveness, and a high cost of goods. We have discovered and optimized a novel class of small-molecule boron-containing compounds, benzoxaboroles, to identify SCYX-7158 as an effective, safe and orally active treatment for HAT.

Csk is a protein tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates other protein tyrosine kinases of the Src family and down-regulates their activities. It is not known how 	Csk	 is regulated. We investigated the possibility that Csk is regulated through phosphorylation by examining if Csk can serve as an in vitro substrate for a panel of protein kinases. We found that Csk was phosphorylated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), but not by protein kinase C, Src, or the fibroblast growth factor receptor kinase. Csk phosphorylation in vitro by PKA is on a serine residue(s) and can reach a stoichiometry of approximately 0.6 mol phosphate per mole of enzyme. Furthermore, incubation with PKA in the presence of ATP and magnesium ion results in a time-dependent decrease in Csk kinase

Our study was concerned with evaluating the effects of the selective COX2 inhibitor, celecoxib, on mammary tumorigenesis and aging in HER2/neu transgenic mice (24). Celecoxib (celebrex) 25 mg/kg was administered 5 times a week from the age of 2 months. Twenty-four intact females were in control. Monitoring kept track of tumor detection time, size, presence of lung metastases, 	food	 and water consumption, estral function, body weight and temperature. No significant differences between the two groups were reported as far as life-span, tumor growth rate, size and number of metastases to the lung is concerned.

This method involves computer-assisted mutation analysis, which allows exact base identity determination and computer-assisted visualization of the specific mutation(s), and thus facilitates data interpretation and management. Sequencing of the entire PCR product is unnecessary, yet the same qualitative characteristics of sequence analysis are maintained. The main benefit of the minisequencing strategy is the use of a mutation analysis protocol based on a common procedure, irrespective of the mutations involved. To evaluate the reliability of this method for subsequent application to PGD, we analysed PCR products from 887 blastomeres including 55 PGD cases of different genetic diseases, such as 	cystic fibrosis	, beta-thalassaemia, sickle cell anaemia, haemophilia A, retinoblastoma, and spinal muscular atrophy. Minisequencing was found to be a useful technique in PGD analysis, due to its elevated sensitivity, automation, and easy data interpretation. The method was also efficient, providing interpretable results in 96.5% (856/887) of the blastomeres tested. Fifteen clinical pregnancies resulted from these PGD cases; conventional prenatal diagnosis confirmed all the PGD results, and 10 healthy babies have already been born. Its applicability to PGD could be helpful, particularly in cases in which the mutation(s) involved are difficult to assess by restriction analysis or other commonly used methods. DOCEND

Si/W/Dy/W films were deposited by dc-magnetron sputtering on Si photodiode substrates, and the transmittance was characterized using synchrotron radiation. The extinction coefficients beta of Dy and the transmittance of a Si capping layer and two W interface barrier layers as functions of energy were solved simultaneously using 	a nonlinear optimization routine	.

Living donor kidney transplantation (KT) is the treatment of choice for end-stage renal disease patients and exhaustive assessment of the potential live kidney donor leads to successful KT in most occasions. Diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension and obesity make up contraindications to donation because all of them are associated with postsurgical complications and future development of 	renal failure	 and cardiovascular (CV) disorders. However, it is unclear how much risk there is for individuals who donate a kidney and then develop some of these complications, which are grouped under the metabolic syndrome (MS.) Indeed, MS is a cluster of CV risk factors such as obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension where the insulin resistance is the pathogenic mainstay. MS is an entity very prevalent in the western countries (20-30%) and has been associated with the development of CV disorders, DM and renal disease. Thus, it is crucial to detect MS before living donation in order to avoid these complications in the long-term.

The cell cycle-regulated Aurora-B kinase is a chromosomal passenger protein that is implicated in fundamental mitotic events, including chromosome alignment and segregation and spindle checkpoint function. Aurora-B phosphorylates serine 10 of histone H3, a function that has been associated with mitotic chromatin condensation. We find that activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) 1 by DNA damage results in a rapid block of H3 phosphorylation. 	PARP-1	 is a NAD(+)-dependent enzyme that plays a multifunctional role in DNA damage detection and repair and maintenance of genomic stability. Here, we show that Aurora-B physically and specifically associates with the BRCT (BRCA-1 C-terminal) domain of PARP-1. Aurora-B becomes highly poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated in response to DNA damage, a modification that leads to a striking inhibition of its kinase activity. The highly similar Aurora-A kinase is not regulated by PARP-1. We propose that the specific inhibition of Aurora-B kinase activity by PARP-1 contributes to the physiological response to DNA damage.

The biofilm formation	 of RO2 was further tested on different RO membranes made of cellulose acetate, polyamide, and thin film composite in continuous flow cell systems. The resultant RO2 biofilms were independent of membrane surface properties and this was probably related to the ex-opolysaccharides secreted bythe biofilm cells.

In vitro digests of disc tissue demonstrated that ADAMTS-4 and -5; cathepsins K, B, and L; and 	MMP-3	, -7, -12, and -13 were incapable of cleavage of chondroadherin at this site and that HTRA1 was indeed the only protease capable. Furthermore, increased protein levels of the processed form of HTRA1 were demonstrated in degenerate disc tissues via immunoblotting. The results suggest that chondroadherin fragmentation can be used as a biomarker to distinguish the processes of disc degeneration from normal aging. DOCEND

BACKGROUND: The Ca2+-binding protein calretinin (CR), while absent in normal colonocytes, is expressed in the majority of poorly differentiated colon carcinomas, and is hypothesized that mutations in the distal part (from exon 7 to 10) of the CR gene (CALB2) could be responsible for the aberrant CR expression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using PCR amplification of genomic DNA and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in CALB2 intron 9. RESULTS: A significant positive association between the genotype

However, its risk associated with consumption of alcohol has not been systematically studied, so this study will provide the first risk assessment of 	formaldehyde	 for consumers of alcoholic beverages.Human dietary intake of formaldehyde via alcoholic beverages in the European Union was estimated based on WHO alcohol consumption data and literature on formaldehyde contents of different beverage groups (beer, wine, spirits, and unrecorded alcohol). The risk assessment was conducted using the margin of exposure (MOE) approach with benchmark doses (BMD) for 10 % effect obtained from dose-response modelling of animal experiments.For tumours in male rats, a BMD of 30 mg kg(-1) body weight per day and a "BMD lower confidence limit" (BMDL) of 23 mg kg(-1) d(-1) were calculated from available long-term animal experiments.

The common factor in the thromboembolic potential of acute myocardial infarction, chronic left ventricular aneurysm and dilated cardiomyopathy is mural thrombus. This can be detected by two-dimensional echocardiography and indium-111 platelet scintigraphy. Although of value in elucidating the natural history of mural thrombus, in most cases, management is not substantially aided by these investigations. In patients with extensive myocardial infarction, particularly anterior infarction, moderate intensity anticoagulation started soon after hospital admission reduces the rate of embolism. After 8 to 12 weeks, embolic risk is low so that 	anticoagulants	 can usually be discontinued. Patients with chronic left ventricular aneurysm have a low incidence of embolism; anticoagulation is, therefore, inappropriate. Dilated cardiomyopathy is associated with a high risk of embolism; moderate intensity anticoagulation may be advisable in many such cases. Little information is available regarding the incidence of thromboembolism or the role of antithrombotic therapy in the patient with a diffusely dilated left ventricle due to ischemic heart disease. In native valve infective endocarditis, the risk of hemorrhage is high, and the efficacy of conventional anticoagulants unclear; thus, anticoagulation should not be instituted for the cardiac condition as such.

In cyanide-induced apoptosis, an increase in cytosolic free Ca2+ and generation of reactive oxygen species are initiation stimuli for apoptotic cell death. Previous studies have shown that 	cyanide	-stimulated translocation of Bax (Bcl-associated X protein) to mitochondria is linked with release of cytochrome c and subsequent activation of a caspase cascade [Shou, Li, Prabhakaran, Borowitz and Isom (2003) Toxicol. Sci. 75, 99-107]. In the present study, the relationship of the cyanide-induced increase in cytosolic free Ca2+ to activation of Bad ( Bcl-2/Bcl-X(L)- antagonist, causing cell death) was determined in cortical cells. Bad is a Ca2+-sensitive pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein, which on activation translocates from cytosol to mitochondria to initiate cytochrome c release. In cultured primary cortical cells, cyanide produced a concentration- and time-dependent translocation of Bad from cytosol to mitochondria.

They received a single oral dose of roflumilast 500 microg on days 1 and 12 and repeated oral doses of rifampicin 600 mg once daily on days 5-15. Plasma concentrations of roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide were measured for up to 96 h. Test/Reference ratios and 90% confidence intervals (CIs) of geometric means for AUC and C(max) of roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide and for oral apparent clearance (CL/F) of roflumilast were estimated. RESULTS: During the steady-state of 	rifampicin	, the AUC(0-infinity) of roflumilast decreased by 80% (point estimate 0.21; 90% CI 0.16, 0.27); C(max) by 68% (0.32; CI 0.26, 0.39); for roflumilast N-oxide, the AUC(0-infinity) decreased by 56% (0.44; CI 0.36, 0.55); C(max) increased by 30% (1.30; 1.15, 1.48); total PDE4 inhibitory activity decreased by 58% (0.42; 0.38, 0.48). CONCLUSIONS: Co-administration of rifampicin and roflumilast led to a reduction in total PDE4 inhibitory activity of roflumilast by about 58%. The use of potent cytochrome P450 inducers may reduce the therapeutic effect of roflumilast. DOCEND

Human serum albumin (HSA) is one of the most abundant proteins in the circulatory system and plays a key role in the transport of fatty acids, metabolites, and drugs. For many drugs, binding to serum albumin is a critical determinant of their distribution and pharmacokinetics; however, there have as yet been 	no high resolution crystal structures	 published of drug-albumin complexes. Here we describe high resolution crystal structures of HSA with two of the most widely used general anesthetics, propofol and halothane.

We show that the intravenous anesthetic propofol binds at two discrete sites on HSA in preformed pockets that have been shown to accommodate fatty acids. Similarly we show that the inhalational agent halothane binds (at concentrations in the pharmacologically relevant range) at three sites that are also fatty acid binding loci.

We developed a method for simultaneous in vivo biophotonic monitoring of pneumococcal meningitis and the accompanying neuronal injury in live transgenic mice. Streptococcus pneumoniae engineered for bioluminescence (lux) was used for direct visualization of disease progression and antibiotic treatment in a mouse model of meningitis. The host response was monitored in transgenic mice containing an inducible firefly luciferase (luc) reporter gene under transcriptional control of the 	mouse	 glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) promoter. Based on the different spectra of light emission and substrate requirements for lux and luc, we were able to separately monitor the two reporters using a highly sensitive in vivo imaging system. The level of neuronal damage and recovery following antibiotic treatment was dependent on the time of treatment. This model has potential for simultaneous multiparameter monitoring and testing of therapies that target the pathogen or host response to prevent neuronal injury and recovery. DOCEND

We found that the extent of internalization measured after a 30-min treatment increased as a function of coupling efficiency, with ephedrine, dobutamine, albuterol, fenoterol, and epinephrine giving 0, 7, 17, 48, and 55% internalization, respectively. With the exception of dobutamine, the rates of down-regulation (k(deg)) also showed a dependence on agonist coupling efficiency, giving (in terms of fraction of receptors lost/h) 0.082 with 	ephedrine	, 0.250 with dobutamine, 0.148 with albuterol, 0.194 with fenoterol, and 0.212 with epinephrine. Comparison of down-regulation to internalization showed that weak agonists caused down-regulation in the absence of significant internalization. The extent of internalization caused by fenoterol over a 1000-fold range of occupancy was proportional to agonist occupancy. However, although no internalization was observed with the low concentrations (0.2 and 2 nM fenoterol), these concentrations did cause significant down-regulation. Thus, as with partial agonists, it was clear that down-regulation occurred in the absence of measurable internalization. The kinetics of agonist-induced down-regulation are consistent with a scheme in which down-regulation proceeds

OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study was to assess the interplay among these four factors and their independent contributions to childhood overweight in a cohort with standard clinical care. METHODS: The cohort included 15 710 mother-offspring pairs delivered in 2011. Logistic regression was used to assess associations between maternal exposures and childhood overweight (body mass index >85th percentile) at age 2 years. RESULTS: Mothers with pre-pregnancy 	obesity	 or overweight were more likely to have EGWG, GDM and less likely to breastfeed >=6 months. Mothers with GDM had 40-49% lower EGWG rates and similar breastfeeding rates compared with mothers without GDM. Analysis adjusted for exposures and covariates revealed an adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) associated with childhood overweight at age 2 years of 2.34 (2.09-2.62), 1.50 (1.34-1.68), 1.23 (1.12-1.35), 0.95 (0.83-1.10) and 0.76 (0.69-0.83) for maternal obesity, overweight, EGWG, GDM and breastfeeding >=6 months vs. <6 months, respectively.

Eptastigmine was administered 45 min before GHRH and blood collected every 15 min until 90 min after GHRH injection. In young dogs, maximum GH plasma levels (Cmax) were 6.1 +/- 1.0 ng/ml after GHRH compared to 22.5 +/- 2.3 ng/ml after GHRH preceded by eptastigmine (P < 0.01). In old animals, Cmax were 4.6 +/- 1.4 ng/ml after GHRH vs 13.2 +/- 7.4 ng/ml after combined administration of GHRH and eptastigmine (P < 0.05). These data indicate that 	eptastigmine	 is very effective in augmenting basal and stimulated GH secretion in old dog. The good activity also shown in old animals suggests a potential use of this drug to reverse the age-dependent decline in GH secretion responsible for many involutional changes of aging. DOCEND

We compared patient age and sex; tumor size; degree and pattern (homogeneous, heterogeneous, predominantly peripheral) of enhancement; presence or absence of calcification; and tumor-spreading patterns including perinephric change, venous invasion, and lymphadenopathy in four subtypes. RESULTS: Conventional renal carcinoma showed stronger enhancement than the other subtypes (p < 0.05): 106 +/- 48 H (mean +/- SD) in the corticomedullary phase and 62 +/- 25 H in the excretory phase. The sensitivity and specificity for differentiating conventional renal carcinoma from the other subtypes were 74% and 	100%	 when 84 H was used as the cutoff value in the corticomedullary phase and 84% and 91% when 44 H was used as the cutoff value in the excretory phase. Conventional (84%), papillary (74%), and collecting duct (100%) renal carcinomas tended to show heterogeneous or predominantly peripheral enhancement, whereas chromophobe renal carcinoma (69%) usually showed homogeneous enhancement. Calcification was more common in papillary (32%) and chromophobe (38%) renal carcinomas than in conventional renal carcinoma (11%) (p < 0.05). Perinephric change and venous invasion were not noted in chromophobe renal carcinoma, whereas both were common in collecting duct renal carcinoma. CONCLUSION: For

ORO staining showed that lipid accumulation in the liver was more extensive in inflamed group despite lower blood lipid levels. Meanwhile, Real Time PCR data showed inflammation induced the expression of LDLr (4.56 fold), SCAP (3.14 fold) and SREBP-2 (14.72 fold) in liver. Immunohistochemical staining also indicated increased proteins expression in the liver, which was consistent with mRNA data.

Tissue sections were selected in such a manner that in addition to glandular benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), one or more different prostatic tumour growth patterns were present. Four monoclonal antibodies, directed against three different PSA epitopes, and one polyclonal anti-PSA antiserum were used. Expression of PSA was compared with that of prostate-specific acid phosphatase (PAP), recognized by 	two different polyclonal antisera	. A critical dilution aimed at a maximum of staining intensity on BPH tissue sections was chosen for all antibodies. Anti-PSA and anti-PAP antisera stained essentially all BPH samples (over 90%). Irrespective of the nature of the antibodies used, PSA expression was found to be decreased in prostatic carcinoma. A clear cut relationship was found between immunoreactivity for PSA and the degree of differentiation of the tumour area. Under the experimental conditions used the PSA monoclonal antibodies stained only 1 out of 10 undifferentiated carcinomas, whereas 50% to 70% of the well- and moderately-differentiated carcinomas showed immunoreactivity.

Following oxidation of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTPP) at a pyrolytic graphite electrode at pH 7.5, two quasi-reversible redox couples emerge at -0.170 and +0.032 V, respectively, due to oxidation products strongly adsorbed to the electrode surface. These redox processes have been electrochemically and kinetically characterized in terms of the dependence of the formal potential (E degrees ') with pH, variation of the current density with scan rate, operational stability, and electron-transfer rate constant (k(s)). The wave centered at +0.032 V could mediate the oxidation of NADH, exhibiting 	a strong and persistent electrocatalytic response	. A quinone-imine structure has been proposed as the electrocatalytically active species. The kinetics of the reaction between the mediator and NADH has been characterized via rotating disk electrode voltammetry, and it has been found that the rate constant for the reaction is dependent on the solution concentration of NADH. 5-HTPP modified electrodes could be employed in the amperometric detection of NADH with a limit of detection in the nanomolar range. Moreover, 5-HTPP modified electrodes retain their electrocatalytic activity for at least one week. The potential application of these electrodes to amperometric biosensor is demonstrated. DOCEND

Several studies have suggested that testosterone has a role in nociception. Recently, we have shown that castration and flutamide, a testosterone antagonist, induce analgesia in the late phase of formalin test, which is related to increase of 5-HT levels in the dorsal horn of the lumbar spinal cord. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, on castration and 	flutamide	-induced analgesia in order to further explore the role of 5-HT systems in such analgesia. Four weeks after castration, there was an analgesia in the late phase of formalin test, and this was potentiated by acute (0.32 mg kg(-1) ip) treatment of fluoxetine. Furthermore, coadministration of fluoxetine (0.32 mg kg(-1) ip) and flutamide (10 mg kg(-1) ip) produced more antinociceptive effect than those animals receiving fluoxetine and flutamide alone. The analgesic effect of fluoxetine (0.32 mg kg(-1) ip) and flutamide (10 mg kg(-1) ip) was abolished by pretreatment with 5,7-DHT (100 microg/rat it) and naloxone (2 mg kg(-1) ip). In

In addition, the two elicitins, which also induced hypersensitive cell death, activated a 44- and a 40-kD kinase with delayed kinetics. By contrast, the cell wall-derived elicitor only weakly activated the 44-kD kinase and failed to activate the 40-kD kinase.

Beginning at T = -90 min, fluorescein disodium acetate was infused intravenously (12.5 mg/kg bolus, then 12.5 mg/kg/hr). Permeability was assessed by calculating the plasma-to-lumen clearance of fluorescein. Five pigs were subjected to complete mesenteric ischemia (T = 0-120 min) followed by reperfusion (T = 120-270 min). In nitrogenated segments, I/R resulted in a 1015 +/- 195% increase in fluorescein clearance (P < 0.01 vs baseline). In contrast, 	the increase	 in fluorescein clearance induced by I/R in oxygenated segments was only 264 +/- 63% (P < 0.01 vs baseline). Intraluminal oxygenation afforded significant (P < .01) protection against I/R-induced mucosal hyperpermeability at all time points from T = 150-270 min. Histologic sections revealed complete villous epithelial denudation in nitrogenated segments, whereas the mucosal epithelium was largely intact in oxygenated segments. After reperfusion, mucosal ATP levels normalized in oxygenated segments, but there was only partial recovery of ATP levels in nitrogenated segments. These data indicate that intraluminal oxygenation ameliorates mucosal hyperpermeability induced by I/R. DOCEND

Today, highly differentiated tumors are surgically removed and not further treated. Cells of many established human neuroblastoma cell lines have the capacity to differentiate when stimulated properly, and these cell lines have been used as models for studying and understanding central concepts of tumor cell differentiation. One recent aspect of this issue is the observation that tumor cells can dedifferentiate and gain 	a stem cell-like phenotype	 during hypoxic conditions, which was first shown in neuroblastoma.

An all PEDOT:PSS Organic Electrochemical Transistor (OECT) has been developed and used for the selective detection of dopamine (DA) in the presence of interfering compounds (ascorbic acid, AA and 	uric acid	, UA). The selective response has been implemented using a potentiodynamic approach, by varying the operating gate voltage and the scan rate. The trans-conductance curves allow to obtain a linear calibration plot for AA, UA and DA and to separate the redox waves associated to each compound; for this purpose, the scan rate is an important parameter to achieve a good resolution. The sensitivities and limits of detection obtained with the OECT have been compared with those obtained by potential step amperometric techniques (cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry), employing a PEDOT:PSS working electrode: our results prove that the all-PEDOT:PSS OECT

We replicated that fluphenazine has a high anti-toxoplasmic activity, but it does not seem to be a phenothiazine-specific class effect: indeed, we found that another first-generation antipsychotic, zuclopenthixol, has a high anti-toxoplasmic activity. Valproate, tiapride and amisulpride have no anti-toxoplasmic activity on parasite growth, and the other antipsychotic drugs showed low or intermediate anti-toxoplasmic activity. As it is not possible to know the intracellular concentrations of antipsychotics in the brain, further clinical studies are warranted to determine whether these in vitro findings have potential implications in treatment of toxo-positive patients with schizophrenia. These findings may be potentially relevant for 	the choice	 of the first-line antipsychotic drug or mood stabilizer in previously infected patients. DOCEND

Before being tested on the plus-maze, the 	mice	 were tested in a holeboard apparatus. All three inverse agonists attenuated the reduction in exploration caused by ethanol in the holeboard test. In the plus-maze, only RO 15-4513 and FG 7142, which possess anxiogenic properties when administered alone, attenuated ethanol's anxiolytic effect. RO 15-3505, which alone had no effect on anxiety, failed to significantly reduce ethanol's anxiolytic effect.

To assess the validity of the examination, a pre-defined algorithm was applied to the nurse's examination findings in patients from both groups, and the sensitivity and specificity of the derived diagnoses were determined in comparison with the clinic's independent diagnosis as the reference standard. RESULTS: The between observer repeatability of physical signs varied from good to excellent, with kappa coefficients of 0.66 to 1.00 for most categorical observations, and mean absolute differences of 1.4 degrees -11.9 degrees for measurements of shoulder movement. The sensitivity of the schedule in comparison with 	the reference standard	 varied between diagnoses from 58%-100%, while the specificities ranged from 84%-100%. The nurse and the clinic physician generally agreed in their diagnoses, but in the presence of shoulder capsulitis the nurse usually also diagnosed shoulder tendinitis, whereas the clinic physician did not. CONCLUSION: The new examination protocol is repeatable and gives acceptable diagnostic accuracy in a hospital setting. Examination can feasibly be delegated to a trained nurse, and the protocol has the benefit of face and construct validity as well as consensus backing. Its performance in the community, where disease is less clear cut, merits separate evaluation, and further refinement

Overexpression of core protein in hepatoma cells increased active TGF-beta levels in culture supernatants and induced Smad2/3 phosphorylation, thus reflecting activation of the TGF-beta signaling pathway. Moreover, our data showed the implication of thrombospondin-1 in core-dependent TGF-beta activation. Finally, hepatoma cells expressing HCV core could activate stellate cells in co-culture and this activation was TGF-beta dependent. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these data delineate a novel paradigm where HCV may be related to liver pathogenesis through its ability to induce a local, intrahepatic TGF-beta activation. They argue for a dual impact of 	HCV	 core on liver fibrosis and liver carcinogenesis: HCV core could act both as autocrine and paracrine factor modulating TGF-beta responses within hepatocytes and in stromal environment through TGF-beta activation.

Transfusion-associated cytomegalovirus mononucleosis is generally considered only as a complication of extracorporeal circulation following cardiac surgery. Three cases following trauma were recognized in less than one year. Both massive and limited volume blood transfusions were involved. Hectic fever was a characteristic feature in these otherwise remarkably asymptomatic individuals, without the classic features of heterophile-positive infectious mononucleosis. Since the illness developed several weeks into 	the post-operative period	 after extensive thoracic or abdominal trauma surgery, the presence of an undrained abscess was naturally the major diagnostic concern. Atypical lymphocytosis, markers of altered immunity (cold agglutinins, rheumatoid factor) and moderate hepatic dysfunction were important laboratory clues. In one case, focal isotope defects in the spleen scan misleadingly suggested a septic complication. A false-positive monospot test initially obscured the correct serologic diagnosis in the same patient. Failure to consider this selflimited viral infection may be a critical factor leading to unnecessary surgery. Other viral agents capable of eliciting a similar syndrome are cited. DOCEND

An ultrastructural immunoperoxidase study demonstrated platelet GPIb and GPIIb/IIIa in both plasma membranes and protein synthesis areas such as perinuclear cisternae and endoplasmic reticulum after TPA induction. beta-TG was also observed in some cytoplasmic granules of TPA-treated cells. TPA remarkably increased the secretion of beta-TG into the culture medium of MEG-01s. Ploidy was also increased from 2C to 4C to 4C to 8C. Similar maturation of MEG-01s was induced by other phorbol diester analogues such as 	phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate	, but not by phorbol itself. These results indicate that phorbol diester, TPA, can bring about differentiation and maturation of a human megakaryoblastic cell line (MEG-01s) and that MEG-01s cells will provide a useful model for studying megakaryocytic differentiation and numerous megakaryocyte-platelet-specific proteins.

The present study was carried out to investigate the antioxidant activity and neuroprotective effects of hydroalcoholic extract of O. sanctum (OSE) on hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced oxidative challenge in SH-SY5Y human neuronal cells. The extract exhibited strong antioxidant activity against 	DPPH	, 2,2'-azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) radical and hydroxyl radicals with IC50 values of 395 +/- 16.2, 241 +/- 11.5 and 188.6 +/- 12.2 mug/ml respectively, which could be due to high amount of polyphenols and flavonoids. The observed data demonstrates 41.5% cell survival with 100 muM H2O2 challenge for 24 h, which was restored to 73% by pre-treatment with OSE for 2 h. It also decreased the lactate dehydrogenase leakage and preserved the cellular morphology. Similarly OSE inhibited lipid peroxidation, DNA damage, reactive oxygen species generation and depolarization of mitochondrial membrane. The extract restored superoxide dismutase and catalase enzyme/protein levels and further downregulated HSP-70 over-expression.

In particular, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) might exert both immunodepressive and proinflammatory actions. The present short review focuses on the regulation of prostanoid synthesis in microglial cultures and on the possible role of PGE2 in the down-regulation of microglial activation induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Our studies were carried out using purified mouse or rat microglial cultures. LPS induced a dose-dependent expression of the inducible isoform of cyclooxygenase (COX-2), both in neonatal and adult microglial cultures. In the latter, the inducibility of 	COX-2	 increased with time in culture, paralleling the acquisition of a more 'activated' microglial phenotype, and appeared to account for the time-dependent increase in the PGE2/TXB2 production ratio. The LPS-induced COX-2 expression and prostanoid production were down-regulated by potentially neurotoxic agents, such as nitric oxide (NO), the proinflammatory cytokine IFN-gamma (which acted both directly and indirectly, through its NO-inducing activity) and the HIV regulatory protein tat. On the other hand, COX-2 expression was up-regulated by the macrophage-deactivating cytokine TGF-beta 1, by exogenous PGE2 itself, which acted through EP2 receptors linked to cyclic AMP generation, and by non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

Quantitative genetics generally is based on the properties of the randomly fertilized (RF) population or inbred derivatives of it. Simple hybrids and hybrid swarms do not conform to this model; and only some properties of 	hybrid means	 appear to have been available. In this paper, several genetical properties are derived, including genotype and allele frequencies, genotypic variance, broad-sense heritability, and outbreeding coefficient. The earlier mean is confirmed, and hybrid vigour is examined critically. These results make it possible to evaluate quantitatively both natural selection and forward selection (in plant breeding) from hybrids. An important finding is that hybrids with maximum hybrid vigour do not maximize genetic advance from forward selection, i.e. evolution is unlikely to enhance hybrid vigour. Another finding is that the concepts of additive genetic variance and narrow-sense heritability are inappropriate for hybrids, owing to

Toxin-resistant macrophages, however, express Nlrp1 proteins which do not harbor the LF cleavage site. We report here that mouse Nlrp1b proteins are also cleaved by LF. In contrast to the situation in rats, sensitivity and resistance of Balb/cJ and NOD/LtJ macrophages does not correlate to the susceptibility of their Nlrp1b proteins to cleavage by LF, as both proteins are cleaved. Two LF cleavage sites, at residues 38 and 44, were identified in 	mouse	 Nlrp1b. Our results suggest that the resistance of NOD/LtJ macrophages to LT, and the inability of the Nlrp1b protein expressed in these cells to be activated by the toxin are likely due to polymorphisms other than those at the LF cleavage sites.

Three hours later, his consciousness deteriorated due to the enlargement of the hematoma. Surgical removal of hematoma relieved his consciousness disturbance. Post-operative magnetic resonance imaging revealed spotty high-intensity lesions in the corpus callosum on T2-weighted images, and a solitary high-intensity lesion in the left caudate nucleus extending to the medial globus pallidum on T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted images. 	Magnetic resonance	 angiography showed no abnormality in the main arteries. These results suggested cerebral infarction in the vascular territory supplied by the recurrent artery of Heubner in association with diffuse brain injury. Post-operative course was uneventful and he was discharged without neurological deficit.

Intracytoplasmic injection of the general UCH-family inhibitor ubiquitin-aldehyde (UBAL) or antibodies against 	UCHL3	 into mature metaphase II oocytes blocked fertilization by reducing sperm penetration of the zona pellucida and incorporation into the ooplasm, suggesting a role for cortical UCHL1 in sperm incorporation. Both UBAL and antibodies against UCHL1 injected at the onset of oocyte maturation (germinal vesicle stage) reduced the fertilizing ability of oocytes. The subfertile Uchl1(gad-/-) mutant mice showed an intriguing pattern of switched UCH localization, with UCHL3 replacing UCHL1 in the oocyte cortex. While fertilization defects were not observed, the embryos from homozygous Uchl1(gad-/-) mutant females failed to undergo morula compaction and did not form blastocysts in vivo, indicating a maternal

Based upon the difference between CSGS and QZ (CSGS without Zhi-Qiao) extracts in the chemical profiles and the regulations of metabolic disturbances induced by CUMS, synephrine, naringin, hesperidin, and neohesperidin were recognized as the active constituents of CSGS from Zhi-qiao responsible for those missing regulations of CSGS when Zhi-Qiao was subtracted from the whole formula.

Of great interest in medical settings, health care proxies are beginning to receive more attention in psychiatric settings. Are these proxies useful when applied to psychiatric treatment decisions? This paper examines health care proxies in Massachusetts and their potential use for decisions about psychiatric interventions at one Massachusetts state hospital. METHOD: A point in time study of a state hospital's entire census was done by reviewing all patients' records for demographic, diagnostic, and legal data, and for the presence and 	content	 of the state required health care proxy form. RESULTS: Of the 161 patients in the hospital, 71 (44%) had full guardians and were ineligible to complete their own proxies. Of the remaining 90 patients, 53 (33% of the total population) had a proxy form in their chart, but 34 (21%) of these patients refused to sign them. Of the 19 (12%) signed proxies, 16 (10%) of the patients were deemed competent to have executed meaningful health care proxies.

GGA-induced signal transduction pathways were investigated by western blot analysis. KEY FINDINGS: Our results showed that GGA significantly decreased melanin content in a concentration-dependent manner. Similarly, GGA reduced tyrosinase activity dose-dependently, but it did not directly inhibit tyrosinase. Western blot analysis indicated that GGA downregulated microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) and tyrosinase protein expression, whereas it increased the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Furthermore, a specific ERK pathway inhibitor, PD98059, blocked GGA-induced melanin reduction and then prevented downregulation of 	MITF	 and tyrosinase by GGA. However, a specific mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, only slightly restored inhibition of melanin production by GGA, indicating that mTOR signaling is not a key mechanism regulating the inhibition of melanin production. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings suggest that activation of ERK by GGA reduces melanin synthesis in Mel-Ab cells through downregulation of MITF and tyrosinase expression. DOCEND

Prostate cancer has the second highest incidence among cancers in men worldwide and is the second leading cause of cancer deaths of men in the United States. Although 	androgen	 deprivation can initially lead to remission, the disease often progresses to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), which is still reliant on androgen receptor (AR) signaling and is associated with a poor prognosis. Some success against CRPC has been achieved by drugs that target AR signaling, but secondary resistance invariably emerges, and new therapies are urgently needed. Recently, inhibitors of bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) family proteins have shown growth-inhibitory activity in preclinical models of CRPC.

In a search for FAO gene expression during development we came across two embryonic differentiation genes: differentiation defective (dif-1) and congested-like trachea (colt) of Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster, respectively. Earlier studies showed that expression of these two genes is essential during developmental stages with high energy requirements. Both dif-1 and colt encode proteins with sequence similarity to the mitochondrial carnitine acylcarnitine carrier (CACT), which suggests that the DIF-1 and COLT proteins might be functional orthologues of CACT. To investigate this, we expressed both dif-1 and colt in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our results show that 	DIF-1	 and COLT can functionally complement a yeast CACT deletion strain and thus function as carnitine acylcarnitine transporters. This finding is well in line with the recent observation that embryos are capable of oxidizing fatty acids and furthermore implies that FAO is essential during early embryonic development when the energy demand is high.

Maintenance of high rates of glycolysis and glutaminolysis at all times can be seen therefore as a device to allow intermediates to be "tapped off" at the precise rate required whenever they are needed for biosynthesis. Maximal activities of some key enzymes of glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle and glutaminolysis from a variety of normal, neoplastic and suppressed cells are presented. The relative activities of hexokinase and 6-phosphofructokinase suggest that, particularly in neoplastic cells, in which the capacity for glucose transport is high, hexokinase could approach saturation in respect to intracellular 	glucose	; consequently, hexokinase and phosphofructokinase could play an important role in the regulation of glycolytic flux in these cells.

The conjugation of amino acids to the protein N termini is universally observed in eukaryotes and prokaryotes, yet its functions remain poorly understood. In eukaryotes, the amino acid l-arginine (l-Arg) is conjugated to N-terminal Asp (Nt-Asp), Glu, Gln, Asn, and Cys, directly or associated with posttranslational modifications. Following Nt-arginylation, the Nt-Arg is recognized by UBR boxes of N-recognins such as UBR1, UBR2, UBR4/p600, and UBR5/	EDD	, leading to substrate ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation via the N-end rule pathway. It has been a mystery, however, why studies for the past five decades identified only a handful of Nt-arginylated substrates in mammals, although five of 20 principal amino acids are eligible for arginylation. Here, we show that the Nt-Arg functions as a bimodal degron that directs substrates to either the ubiquitin (Ub)-proteasome system (UPS) or macroautophagy depending on physiological states.

Subjects pressed a response button to high-pitched target tones (P=0.20) that were randomly intermixed with low-pitched frequent tones. We measured pre-stimulus readiness potential (RP), event-related potentials (P50, N100, P200, 	N200	 and P300), and reaction time as a function of the stimulus sequence.

The purpose of this study was to provide indirect evidence of short-term hyperosmolar conditions during tear instability and to test whether the corneal epithelium responds to transient hyperosmolar stress. METHODS: Five subjects kept one eye open as long as possible, and overall discomfort and sensations associated with tear break-up were scaled. Later, the same subjects used the same scales to report discomfort sensations after instillation of NaCl and sucrose hyperosmolar drops (300-1000 mOsM/kg). 	A two-alternative, forced-choice	 experiment was used to obtain osmolarity thresholds. In the second experiment, primary cultured bovine corneal epithelial cells were transiently stressed with the same range of hyperosmolar culture medium, and proinflammatory mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPKs) were measured by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: Tear instability led to an average discomfort rating of 6.13 and sensations of burning and stinging. These sensations also occurred with hyperosmolar solutions (thresholds, 450-460 mOsM/kg) that required 800 to 900 mOsM/kg to generate the same discomfort levels reported during tear break-up.

Much recent work on the use of computed tomography (CT) and transesophageal echocardiography in screening for and facilitating the diagnosis of acute thoracic aortic injury in the patient with blunt chest trauma has shown 	favorable results	. This has led some physicians to question whether conventional thoracic aortography is still the reference standard. The purpose of this review article is to summarize the epidemiology and pathophysiology of acute thoracic aortic injury, the current status of the individual imaging modalities in use, and the surgeon's perspective. Despite a burgeoning literature and a confounding array of clinical and imaging advances, timely diagnosis of acute thoracic aortic injury remains a challenge. To overcome this problem, some trauma centers have used CT, transesophageal echocardiography, or both, in their diagnostic algorithm for acute thoracic aortic injury. These diagnostic algorithms are individually tailored

These enzymes reduce oxygen to water and use the free energy from this reaction to maintain a proton-motive force across the membrane in which they are embedded. The heme-copper oxidases of the cbb3-type are only found in bacteria, often pathogenic ones since they have a low Km for O2, enabling the bacteria to colonize semi-anoxic environments. Cbb3-type (C) oxidases are highly divergent from the mitochondrial-like aa3-type (A) oxidases, and within the heme-copper oxidase family, cbb3 is the closest relative to the most divergent member, the bacterial nitric oxide reductase (NOR). Nitric oxide reductases reduce NO to 	N2O	 without coupling the reaction to the generation of any electrochemical proton gradient. The significant structural differences between A- and C-type heme-copper oxidases are manifested in the lack in cbb3 of most of the amino acids found to be important for proton pumping in the A-type, as well as in the different binding characteristics of ligands such as CO, O2 and NO. Investigations of the reasons for these differences at a molecular level have provided insights into the mechanism of O2 and NO reduction as well as the proton-pumping mechanism in all heme-copper oxidases.

The objective of this study was to investigate diurnal variation in processes that regulate drug concentrations in the brain, focusing on P-glycoprotein (P-gp). This efflux transporter limits the distribution of many drugs in the brain. To this end, the exposure to the P-gp substrate quinidine was determined in the plasma and brain tissue after intravenous administration in rats at six different time points over the 24-h period. Our results indicate that time of administration significantly affects the exposure to 	quinidine	 in the brain. Upon inhibition of P-gp, exposure to quinidine in brain tissue is constant over the 24-h period. To gain more insight into processes regulating brain concentrations, we used intracerebral microdialysis to determine the concentration of quinidine in brain extracellular fluid (ECF) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) after intravenous administration at two different time points. The data were analyzed by physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling using NONMEM. The model shows that the variation is due to higher activity of P-gp-mediated transport from the deep brain compartment to the plasma compartment during the active period.

Nucleic Acids Res. 33, 1-12), we found that the Eh1 domain of Nkx6 did not significantly enhance repression in Gal4 chimeric assays. However, when we performed co-immunoprecipitation analyses, we found that Nkx6 can bind Groucho and that binding of Nkx6 to this co-repressor is modulated intra-molecularly. Full length Nkx6 interacted with Groucho poorly, because sequences at the carboxyl terminal of NKx6 interfere with Groucho binding, despite the presence of the Eh1 domain. In contrast, a carboxyl terminal Nkx6 deletion bound Groucho strongly. In keeping with the presence of 	an activation domain	 within Nkx6, we also report that Nkx6 can activate reporter expression driven by an Nkx6.1 enhancer that mediates auto-activation in transient transfection assays. The presence of multiple repression domains in Nkx6 supports Nkx6's role as a repressor, potentially using both Groucho-dependent and independent mechanisms. Thus, Nkx6 likely functions as a dual regulator in embryos. DOCEND

The mechanism for DC depletion, however, is unclear. It is also known that vast quantities of viral envelope protein gp120 are shed from maturing HIV-1 virions and form circulating immune complexes in the serum of 	HIV-1	-infected individuals, but the pathological role of gp120 in HIV-1 pathogenesis remains elusive. Here we describe a previously unrecognized mechanism of DC death in chronic HIV-1 infection, in which ligation of DC-SIGN by gp120 sensitizes DC to undergo accelerated apoptosis in response to a variety of activation stimuli. The cultured monocyte-derived DC and also freshly-isolated DC-SIGN+ blood DC that were exposed to either cross-linked recombinant gp120 or immune-complex gp120 in HIV+ serum underwent considerable apoptosis after CD40 ligation or exposure to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFalpha and IL-1beta. Furthermore, circulating DC-SIGN+ DC that were isolated directly

The cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) procedure has been shown to be a possible cause of postoperative neurological morbidity for various reasons, including: large amounts of gaseous microemboli (GME) reaching the patient and hypoperfusion of the patient due to "stolen" blood flow. This study used a simulated CPB circuit identical to that in a clinical setting to examine three different hollow-fiber membrane oxygenators without intergrated arterial filters - the Capiox RX05, the Quadrox-i neonatal, and the KIDS D100 - to determine their ability to reduce 	the number	 of GME delivered to the neonatal patient and their hemodynamic properties in response to varying flow rates, normothermic vs hypothermic conditions, and open vs closed purge line. The circuit was primed with Ringer's Lactate and then human blood with a hematocrit of 30%. Injections of 5cc bolusses of air were injected into the venous line proximal to the venous reservoir over a thirty-second interval.

Embryonic stem (ES) cells are a powerful model for the development of cells responsible for the cellular immune response. Therefore, we analyzed the defense and phagocytic capacity of embryoid bodies (EBs) derived from ES cells using in the vitro inflammatory conditions caused by Escherichia coli. Further, we used this phagocytic activity to purify activated immune cells. Our data show that spontaneously differentiated 18-day-old EBs of the cell line CGR8 contained immune cells, which were positive for 	CD45	, CD68, CD11b, F4/80, and CD19. Exposure of these EBs to E. coli with defined infection doses of bacterial colony-forming units (CFUs) led to a significant time-dependent reduction of CFUs, indicating the immune responses exerted by EBs. This was paralleled by an upregulation of inflammatory cytokines, that is, IL-1beta and TNF-alpha. Western blot analysis of infected EBs indicated an upregulation of CD14 and cytochrome b-245 heavy chain (NOX2). Silencing of NOX2 significantly reduced the antibacterial capacity of EBs, which was partially explained by reduction of F4/80-positive cells. To identify, isolate, and further cultivate phagocytic active cells from differentiated EBs, a cocultivation

Estrogen is the primary sex hormone responsible for the development and modulation of the female reproductive system in all vertebrates including avian species. The actions of estrogen are mediated by the estrogen receptor, which could be modulated by the selective estrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen (TAM). In this study, we administered TAM into the actively laying chicken to investigate the ovarian and hypothalamic responses to the estrogen action blockage. The laying was disrupted and the development of the pre-ovulatory hierarchical follicles was arrested. However, the TAM treatment caused an increase of 	estrogen	 level in both serum and ovary. Among the main estrogen targeted tissues, the hypothalamus showed specific dopaminergic activation as indicated by gene expression analysis. In the ovary, l-dopa, the precursor of dopamine, could stimulate the estrogen synthesis in undifferentiated follicles but not in the differentiated pre-ovulatory follicles. Thus, we established a feedback loop links ovarian estrogen production with hypothalamic l-dopa synthesis and we propose that the dopamine is involved in estrogen action to regulate the ovarian follicle development and ovulation.

The HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins, exemplified by the gp120 monomer, are the focus of vaccines aimed at inducing B cell responses. We have studied how the interactions of gp120 with various receptors on human pDCs affect the activation of these cells via TLR9 and their subsequent ability to stimulate B cells. We observed that IFN-alpha production by pDCs in response to TLR9, but not TLR7, stimulation was reduced by exposure to gp120. Specifically, gp120 inhibited the CpG-induced maturation of pDCs and 	their expression	 of TNF-alpha, IL-6, TLR9, IFN regulatory factor 7, and BAFF. Receptor-blocking and cross-linking studies showed that these inhibitory effects of gp120 were mediated by interactions with CD4 and mannose-binding C-type lectin receptors, but not with the chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR4. Of note is that gp120 inhibited the activation of B cells by TLR9-stimulated pDCs. Taken together, our data show that HIV-1 gp120 impairs pDC functions, including activation of B cell responses, and imply that TLR9 ligands may not be good adjuvants to use in combination with envelope glycoprotein vaccines.

The aggregation behavior was examined over a range of solution chemistries, by adjusting the concentration of the supporting electrolyte-NaCl, CaCl2, or simulated seawater. With the solution pH adjusted so that NOM-coated and bare hematite colloids were at the same zeta potential, we observed a significant difference in colloid stability which results from the stability imparted to the colloids by the adsorbed NOM macromolecules. This enhanced stability of NOM-coated hematite colloids was not observed with CaCl2. Aggregate form expressed as fractal dimension was determined for both NOM-coated and bare 	hematite	 aggregates in both NaCl and CaCl2. The fractal dimensions of aggregates formed in the diffusion-limited regime indicate slightly more loosely packed aggregates for bare hematite than theory predicts. For NOM-coated hematite, a small decrease in fractal dimension was observed when the solution composition changed from NaCl to CaCl2. For systems in the reaction-limited regime, the measured fractal dimensions agreed with those in the literature. Colloid aggregation was also studied in synthetic seawater, a mixed cation system to simulate estuarine mixing.

The gene KRAS is commonly mutated in lung cancer to encode a constitutively active and oncogenic protein that is well established to initiate and maintain lung tumorigenesis. However, the remaining wild-type KRAS protein, or the other family members HRAS and NRAS, can still be activated in the presence of oncogenic KRAS. Moreover, loss of any one of these three genes has been shown to increase the sensitivity of mice to the carcinogen urethane, which induces Kras mutation-positive early lung lesions. To determine the contribution of progressively disrupting Hras and Nras genes on 	urethane	 lung tumorigenesis, mice with different combinations of wild-type and null alleles of Hras and Nras were exposed with urethane and tumor burden was assessed. As previously reported, loss of one allele of Hras increased the sensitivity of mice to this carcinogen, and this effect was further exacerbated by the loss of the second Hras allele. However, loss of one or both alleles of Nras failed to alter tumor burden, either in the absence or presence of Hras, after exposure to urethane. Additionally, no obvious difference between lung lesions in mice with wild-type versus null alleles was detected, suggesting that wild-type

METHODS: A 30-year-old man is described, in whom, 2 years after radiation therapy for Stage IIIA Hodgkin disease, a testicular nonseminomatous germ cell tumor developed with metastatic spread to the retroperitoneal lymph nodes, lung, and left supraclavicular fossa. The second case report describes a 31-year-old man in whom a metastasizing nonseminomatous testicular cancer, with elevation of levels of the serum tumor markers alpha-fetoprotein and 	human	 chorionic gonadotropin, developed simultaneously with axillary lymphadenopathy that was histologically confirmed Hodgkin disease.

In insulin-resistant Zucker (fa/fa) rats, T0901317 significantly improved insulin sensitivity.

Nuclear run-on studies indicated that transcriptional repression was primarily responsible for the inhibition of PEPCK by the LXR agonist. In addition, we show that the regulation of the liver gluconeogenic pathway by LXR agonists was a direct effect on hepatocytes. These data not only suggest that LXRs are novel targets for diabetes but also reveal an unanticipated role for these receptors, further linking lipid and glucose metabolism. DOCEND

First results demonstrate that linkage of helper and killer epitopes on the surface of one antigen-presenting cell is a prerequisite for productive interaction between the two T cells that results in induction of cytolytic activity. T helper 1 and T helper 2 cells are equally efficient. The crucial roles of interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma in this process were confirmed.

To elucidate the mechanism of this inhibition, we examined the effect of IL1 on the synthesis of interferon-beta (IFN-beta), stimulated with polyinosinate.polycytidylate [poly(I).poly(C)]. When added 2 h or more before poly(I).poly(C), both forms of IL1 had a strong inhibitory effect on IFN-beta synthesis, as determined by antiviral assay of the IFN-beta protein or by quantitation of IFN-beta mRNA levels in Northern blot analysis. However, when IL1 was added simultaneously with poly(I).poly(C), or 2 h after poly(I).poly(C), IFN-beta synthesis was increased. The inhibitory action of IL1 on poly(I).poly(C)-induced IFN-beta synthesis was abolished in the presence of 	cycloheximide	, suggesting that it is mediated indirectly by an IL1-induced product in the FS-4 cells. In addition to its ability to inhibit IFN-beta synthesis, IL1 also caused a partial reversal of the antiviral action of IFN-beta. In contrast to IL1, TNF did not inhibit IFN-beta synthesis, nor did it interfere with the antiviral action of IFN-beta. Simultaneous addition of TNF and poly(I).poly(C) to FS-4 cells enhanced IFN-beta synthesis. Under proper conditions TNF and IFN-beta showed an additive antiviral effect. DOCEND

This study examined 	the interactive effects	 of cerebrovascular risks, advancing age, and HIV infection on neurocognition, and explored whether pharmacological treatment of cerebrovascular risk factors attenuated neurocognitive dysfunction. Participants included 98 HIV-seropositive adults (cerebrovascular risk: 23.5%; age > 50: 27.6%). Cerebrovascular risk was associated with slower processing speed even after controlling for age effects (b = -2.071; p =.04), and the interaction of age and cerebrovascular risk was associated with poorer verbal fluency (b = 1.276, p =.002). Participants with pharmacologically untreated cerebrovascular risk demonstrated reduced processing speed, learning/memory, and executive functioning relative to those on medication. Poor cerebrovascular health confers significant risk for HIV+ individuals, and this effect

The kinetics of interaction of PPi and its diphosphonic analog, methylenediphosphonic acid (MDPA), with nucleoside triphosphates, DNA and Mg2+ binding sites of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II from calf thymus was investigated. The values of apparent Km in the NTP polymerization reaction for ATP and CTP equal to 2.7 X 10(-4) and 1.8 X 10(-4) M, respectively, were determined. It was shown that MDPA and PPi competitively inhibited the RNA polymerase reaction with respect to nucleoside triphosphate. The inhibition constants (Ki) of 	ATP	 and CTP incorporation for MDPA were 2.2 X 10(-4) and 3.3 X 10(-4) M, respectively, while those of the nucleoside triphosphate incorporation for PPi were equal to 1.4 X 10(-4) and 2.0 X 10(-4) M, respectively. MDPA and PPi were incompetitive inhibitors of template (DNA) and Mn2+. A possible mechanism of inhibition of the RNA polymerase reaction by MDPA is proposed. DOCEND

Overproduction of PC and its mutant enzyme P455S in M168-20 had no positive effect on the volumetric L-lysine yield and the L-lysine yield on methanol, and caused significantly reduced volumetric L-glutamate yield and L: -glutamate yield on methanol. Our results demonstrated that hom-1 represents one key target for achieving L-lysine overproduction, PC activity plays an important role in controlling L-glutamate production from methanol, and that 	OAA	 precursor supply is not a major bottleneck for L-lysine overproduction by B. methanolicus.

In addition, in all zones a decrease in the volume density of mitochondria and lysosomes was noted, whereas the volume of microbodies was increased. It is suggested that this loss in total membrane material within the cell may be secondary to the degranulation and decrease in total surface area of rough surfaced endoplasmic reticulum, an organelle thought to be responsible in part for the synthesis of new cellular membranes.

RESULTS: Methylation of the promoter and loss of mRNA expression was found both in cell lines and primary tumors (43% and 51%, respectively). Using Cox modeling, a trend was found towards decreased hazard ratio (HR) for death in women with methylation of FBXW7/hCDC4-beta in both cohorts (HR 0.53 (95% CI 0.23 to 1.23) and HR 0.50 (95% CI 0.23 to 1.08), respectively), despite an association between methylation and high-grade tumors (P = 0.017). Interestingly, in subgroups of patients whose tumors are 	p53	 mutated or lymph-node positive, promoter methylation identified patients with significantly improved survival (P = 0.048 and P = 0.017, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate an alternative mechanism for inactivation of the TSG FBXW7/hCDC4, namely promoter specific methylation. Importantly, in breast cancer, methylation of FBXW7/hCDC4-beta is related to favorable prognosis despite its association with poorly differentiated tumors. Future work may define whether FBXW7/hCDC4 methylation is a biomarker of the response to chemotherapy and a target for epigenetic modulation therapy. DOCEND
24119663	T22	out	DOCSTART HIV trafficking in host cells: motors wanted! Throughout the viral replication cycle, viral proteins, complexes, and particles need to be transported within host cells. These transport events are dependent on the host cell cytoskeleton and molecular motors. However, the mechanisms by which 	virus	 is trafficked along cytoskeleton filaments and how molecular motors are recruited and regulated to guarantee successful integration of the viral genome and production of new viruses has only recently begun to be understood. Recent studies on HIV have identified specific molecular motors involved in the trafficking of these viral particles. Here we review recent literature on the transport of HIV components in the cell, provide evidence for the identity and role of molecular motors in this process, and highlight how these trafficking events may be related to those occurring with other viruses.

Asthma is characterized by bronchial inflammation and hyperresponsiveness that involves mast cell tryptase and potentially its specific receptor protease activated receptor 2 (	PAR-2	). Tryptase increases free intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i), a key step in activation of human airway smooth muscle cells (HASMC). The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of PAR-2 gene silencing on HASMC, in terms of calcium response, since no antagonist is available for this receptor. Five siRNA against PAR-2 were synthesized and transfected in HASMC using lipid agents, and PAR-2 expression was examined using Western blot, fluorescence-activated cell sorter, immunocytochemistry and RT-PCR. [Ca2+]i was measured using microspectrofluorimetry in response to tryptase, the activating peptide SLIGKV, trypsin, or caffeine. Two siRNA significantly inhibited PAR-2 expression in terms of

AIM: To evaluate the status of anorectal function after repeated transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM). METHODS: Twenty-one patients undergoing subtotal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis were included. There were more than 5 large (> 1 cm) polyps in the remaining rectum (range: 6-20 cm from the anal edge). All patients, 	19	 with villous adenomas and 2 with low-grade adenocarcinomas, underwent TEM with submucosal endoscopic excision at least twice between 2005 and 2011. Anorectal manometry and a questionnaire about incontinence were carried out at week 1 before operation, and at weeks 2 and 3 and 6 mo after the last operation. Anal resting pressure, maximum squeeze pressure, maximum tolerable volume (MTV) and rectoanal inhibitory reflexes (RAIR) were recorded. The integrity and thickness of the internal anal sphincter (IAS) and external anal sphincter (EAS) were also evaluated by endoanal ultrasonography. We determined the physical and mental health status with SF-36 score to assess

Oral administration of 	N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine	 induced gastrointestinal tumors in 15 out of 19 rats: six adenomas, seven adenocarcinomas, one fibrosarcoma and one malignant schwannoma that was homotransplantable. Both the original and transplantable tumor exhibited characteristic morphological features and immunoreactivity identical to that of a human malignant schwannoma: positive reaction for S-100 protein, neuron specific enolase, glial fibrillary acidic protein, myelin basic protein and vimentin. In addition, alpha-smooth muscle actin was expressed in both tumors. Cultured tumor cells derived from the transplantable tumor at passage 3 produced 18 clones which showed anchorage independent growth in soft agar.

The small GTPase Ran, which regulates a variety of processes throughout the cell cycle, including interphase nucleocytoplasmic transport and mitotic spindle assembly, was recently shown to also control spindle alignment. Ran is required for the correct cortical localization of LGN and nuclear-mitotic apparatus protein (NuMA), proteins that generate pulling forces on astral microtubules (MTs) through cytoplasmic dynein. Here we use importazole, a small-molecule inhibitor of RanGTP/importin-beta function, to study the role of Ran in spindle positioning in human cells. We find that importazole treatment results in 	defects	 in astral MT dynamics, as well as in mislocalization of LGN and NuMA, leading to misoriented spindles. Of interest, importazole-induced spindle-centering defects can be rescued by nocodazole treatment, which depolymerizes astral MTs, or by overexpression of CLASP1, which does not restore proper LGN and NuMA localization but stabilizes astral MT interactions with the cortex. Together our data suggest a model for mitotic spindle positioning in which RanGTP and CLASP1 cooperate to align the spindle along the long axis of the dividing cell. DOCEND

From a subtracted cDNA library of rat luteal tissue, where cDNA fragments in functional luteal tissue were subtracted from those in regressing luteal tissue, a cDNA clone corresponding to 26-cholesterol hydroxylase (P450(C26)) was obtained. It is known that P450(C26) catalyzes the conversion of cholesterol to 26-hydroxycholesterol, which blocks cholesterol utilization in the cell, and that 	20alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase	 (20alpha-HSD) catalyzes the conversion of progesterone to an inactive steroid, 20alpha-dihydroprogesterone (20alpha-OHP). Thus, using pseudopregnant rats as a model, physiological cooperation of P450(C26) and 20alpha-HSD in the reduction of progesterone release toward the end of the luteal phase was evaluated. Levels of P450(C26) and 20alpha-HSD mRNA were examined in corpora lutea from pseudopregnant rats by Northern blot or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction or both. P450(C26) mRNA was ubiquitously expressed in corpora lutea, and its expression increased toward the end of pseudopregnancy, while 20alpha-HSD was expressed in all corpora lutea on Day 16 (Day 0 = the day of after cervical stimulation)

Recent data suggests that calcitonin (CT) and/or calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) may be potential transmitters or modulators in the nervous system. The present study analyzed the effect of CT and CGRP on the neuronal membranes of cat parasympathetic ganglia of the urinary bladder. The related peptides prolonged the duration of the afterhyperpolarization of the action potential but had 	no effect	 on resting potential or input resistance. CT and CGRP enhanced the duration of a calcium spike recorded in the presence of agents blocking Na and K channels while under similar conditions forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase, did not affect the calcium spike. These data suggest that the neural mechanism of action of CT and CGRP is to prolong a calcium conductance and that these effects are not mediated through cyclic AMP. DOCEND

Antibiotic application in plant agriculture is primarily used to control fire blight caused by Erwinia amylovora in pome fruit orchards. In order to facilitate environmental impact assessment for antibiotic applications, we developed and validated culture-independent quantitative real-time PCR multiplex assays for streptomycin (strA, strB, aadA and insertion sequence IS1133) and tetracycline (tetB, tetM and tetW) resistance elements in plant and soil samples. The qPCR were reproducible and consistent whether the DNA was extracted directly from bacteria, plant and soil samples inoculated with bacteria or soil samples prior to and after manure slurry treatment. 	The genes most frequently identified in soils pre- and post-slurry treatment	 were strB, aadA, tetB and tetM. All genes tested were detected in soils pre-slurry treatment, and a decrease in relative concentrations of tetB and the streptomycin resistance genes was observed in samples taken post-slurry treatment. These multiplex qPCR assays offer a cost-effective, reliable method for simultaneous quantification of antibiotic resistance genes in complex, environmental sample matrices. DOCEND
